<p class="first">The Gilgamesh Epic is the most notable literary
product of Babylonia as yet discovered in the mounds of Mesopotamia. It
recounts the exploits and adventures of a favorite hero, and in its
final form covers twelve tablets, each tablet consisting of six columns
(three on the obverse and three on the reverse) of about 50 lines for
each column, or a total of about 3600 lines. Of this total, however,
barely more than one-half has been found among the remains of the great
collection of cuneiform tablets gathered by King Ashurbanapal
(668&ndash;626 B.C.) in his palace at Nineveh, and discovered by Layard
in 1854<a class="noteref" id="xd26e188src" href="#xd26e188" name=
"xd26e188src">1</a> in the course of his excavations of the mound
Kouyunjik (opposite Mosul). The fragments of the epic painfully
gathered&mdash;chiefly by George Smith&mdash;from the <i>circa</i>
30,000 tablets and bits of tablets brought to the British Museum were
published in model form by Professor Paul Haupt;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e202src" href="#xd26e202" name="xd26e202src">2</a> and that
edition still remains the primary source for our study of the Epic.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="p10" href="#p10" name=
"p10">10</a>]</span></p>
<p>For the sake of convenience we may call the form of the Epic in the
fragments from the library of Ashurbanapal the Assyrian version, though
like most of the literary productions in the library it not only
reverts to a Babylonian original, but represents a late copy of a much
older original. The absence of any reference to Assyria in the
fragments recovered justifies us in assuming that the Assyrian version
received its present form in Babylonia, perhaps in Erech; though it is
of course possible that some of the late features, particularly the
elaboration of the teachings of the theologians or schoolmen in the
eleventh and twelfth tablets, may have been produced at least in part
under Assyrian influence. A definite indication that the Gilgamesh Epic
reverts to a period earlier than Hammurabi (or Hammurawi)<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e309src" href="#xd26e309" name="xd26e309src">3</a>
i.e., beyond 2000 B. C., was furnished by the publication of a text
clearly belonging to the first Babylonian dynasty (of which Hammurabi
was the sixth member) in <i>CT</i>. VI, 5; which text Zimmern<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e321src" href="#xd26e321" name="xd26e321src">4</a>
recognized as a part of the tale of Atra-&#7723;asis, one of the names
given to the survivor of the deluge, recounted on the eleventh tablet
of the Gilgamesh Epic.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e326src" href=
"#xd26e326" name="xd26e326src">5</a> This was confirmed by the
discovery<a class="noteref" id="xd26e335src" href="#xd26e335" name=
"xd26e335src">6</a> of a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="p11" href="#p11"
name="p11">11</a>]</span>fragment of the deluge story dated in the
eleventh year of Ammisaduka, i.e., c. 1967 B.C. In this text, likewise,
the name of the deluge hero appears as Atra-&#7723;asis (col. VIII,
4).<a class="noteref" id="xd26e347src" href="#xd26e347" name=
"xd26e347src">7</a> But while these two tablets do not belong to the
Gilgamesh Epic and merely introduce an episode which has also been
incorporated into the Epic, Dr. Bruno Meissner in 1902 published a
tablet, dating, as the writing and the internal evidence showed, from
the Hammurabi period, which undoubtedly is a portion of what by way of
distinction we may call an old Babylonian version.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e350src" href="#xd26e350" name="xd26e350src">8</a> It was
picked up by Dr. Meissner at a dealer&rsquo;s shop in Bagdad and
acquired for the Berlin Museum. The tablet consists of four columns
(two on the obverse and two on the reverse) and deals with the
hero&rsquo;s wanderings in search of a cure from disease with which he
has been smitten after the death of his companion Enkidu. The hero
fears that the disease will be fatal and longs to escape death. It
corresponds to a portion of Tablet X of the Assyrian version.
Unfortunately, only the lower portion of the obverse and the upper of
the reverse have been preserved (57 lines in all); and in default of a
colophon we do not know the numeration of the tablet in this old
Babylonian edition. Its chief value, apart from its furnishing a proof
for the existence of the Epic as early as 2000 B. C., lies (a) in the
writing <i>Gish</i> instead of Gish-gi(n)-mash in the Assyrian version,
for the name of the hero, (b) in the writing
En-ki-d&#361;&mdash;abbreviated from d&#361;g&mdash;(<img src=
"images/cu11-1.gif" alt="" width="26" height="24">) &ldquo;Enki is
good&rdquo; for En-ki-d&uacute; (<img src="images/cu11-2.gif" alt=""
width="20" height="19">) in the Assyrian version,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e368src" href="#xd26e368" name="xd26e368src">9</a> and (c) in the
remarkable address of the maiden Sabitum, dwelling at the seaside, to
whom Gilgamesh comes in the course of his wanderings. From the Assyrian
version we know that the hero tells the maiden of his grief for his
lost companion, and of his longing to escape the dire fate of Enkidu.
In the old Babylonian fragment the answer of Sabitum is given in full,
and the sad note that it strikes, showing how hopeless it is for man to
try to escape death which is in store for all mankind, is as remarkable
as is the philosophy of &ldquo;eat, drink and be merry&rdquo; which
Sabitum imparts. The address indicates how early the tendency arose to
attach to ancient tales the current religious teachings. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="p12" href="#p12" name="p12">12</a>]</span></p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Why, O Gish, does thou run about?</p>
<p class="line">The life that thou seekest, thou wilt not find.</p>
<p class="line">When the gods created mankind,</p>

<p class="line">Care for the little one who takes hold of thy hand!</p>
<p class="line">Let the wife rejoice in thy bosom!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Such teachings, reminding us of the leading thought in
the Biblical Book of Ecclesiastes,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e405src"
href="#xd26e405" name="xd26e405src">10</a> indicate the <i>didactic</i>
character given to ancient tales that were of popular origin, but which
were modified and elaborated under the influence of the schools which
arose in connection with the Babylonian temples. The story itself
belongs, therefore, to a still earlier period than the form it received
in this old Babylonian version. The existence of this tendency at so
early a date comes to us as a genuine surprise, and justifies the
assumption that the attachment of a lesson to the deluge story in the
Assyrian version, to wit, the limitation in attainment of immortality
to those singled out by the gods as exceptions, dates likewise from the
old Babylonian period. The same would apply to the twelfth tablet,
which is almost entirely didactic, intended to illustrate the
impossibility of learning anything of the fate of those who have passed
out of this world. It also emphasizes the necessity of contenting
oneself with the comfort that the care of the dead, by providing burial
and food and drink offerings for them affords, as the only means of
ensuring for them rest and freedom from the pangs of hunger and
distress. However, it is of course possible that the twelfth tablet,
which impresses one as a supplement to the adventures of Gilgamesh,
ending with his return to Uruk (i.e., Erech) at the close of the
eleventh tablet, may represent a <i>later</i> elaboration of the
tendency to connect religious teachings with the exploits of a favorite
hero. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="p13" href="#p13" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We now have further evidence both of the extreme
antiquity of the literary form of the Gilgamesh Epic and also of the
disposition to make the Epic the medium of illustrating aspects of life
and the destiny of mankind. The discovery by Dr. Arno Poebel of a
Sumerian form of the tale of the descent of Ishtar to the lower world
and her release<a class="noteref" id="xd26e427src" href="#xd26e427"
name="xd26e427src">11</a>&mdash;apparently a nature myth to illustrate
the change of season from summer to winter and back again to
spring&mdash;enables us to pass beyond the Akkadian (or Semitic) form
of tales current in the Euphrates Valley to the Sumerian form.
Furthermore, we are indebted to Dr. Langdon for the identification of
two Sumerian fragments in the Nippur Collection which deal with the
adventures of Gilgamesh, one in Constantinople,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e442src" href="#xd26e442" name="xd26e442src">12</a> the other in
the collection of the University of Pennsylvania Museum.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e451src" href="#xd26e451" name="xd26e451src">13</a>
The former, of which only 25 lines are preserved (19 on the obverse and
6 on the reverse), appears to be a description of the weapons of
Gilgamesh with which he arms himself for an encounter&mdash;presumably
the encounter with &#7722;umbaba or &#7722;uwawa, the ruler of the
cedar forest in the mountain.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e458src" href=
"#xd26e458" name="xd26e458src">14</a> The latter deals with the
building operations of Gilgamesh in the city of Erech. A text in
Zimmern&rsquo;s <i lang="de">Sumerische Kultlieder aus altbabylonischer
Zeit</i> (Leipzig, 1913), No. 196, appears likewise to be a fragment of
the Sumerian version of the Gilgamesh Epic, bearing on the episode of
Gilgamesh&rsquo;s and Enkidu&rsquo;s relations to the goddess Ishtar,
covered in the sixth and seventh tablets of the Assyrian
version.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e471src" href="#xd26e471" name=
"xd26e471src">15</a></p>
<p>Until, however, further fragments shall have turned up, it would be
hazardous to institute a comparison between the Sumerian and the
Akkadian versions. All that can be said for the present is that there
is every reason to believe in the existence of a literary form of the
Epic in Sumerian which presumably antedated the Akkadian recension,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="p14" href="#p14" name=
"p14">14</a>]</span>just as we have a Sumerian form of Ishtar&rsquo;s
descent into the nether world, and Sumerian versions of creation myths,
as also of the Deluge tale.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e484src" href=
"#xd26e484" name="xd26e484src">16</a> It does not follow, however, that
the Akkadian versions of the Gilgamesh Epic are translations of the
Sumerian, any more than that the Akkadian creation myths are
translations of a Sumerian original. Indeed, in the case of the
creation myths, the striking difference between the Sumerian and
Akkadian views of creation<a class="noteref" id="xd26e499src" href=
"#xd26e499" name="xd26e499src">17</a> points to the independent
production of creation stories on the part of the Semitic settlers of
the Euphrates Valley, though no doubt these were worked out in part
under Sumerian literary influences. The same is probably true of Deluge
tales, which would be given a distinctly Akkadian coloring in being
reproduced and steadily elaborated by the Babylonian <i>literati</i>
attached to the temples. The presumption is, therefore, in favor of an
independent <i>literary</i> origin for the Semitic versions of the
Gilgamesh Epic, though naturally with a duplication of the episodes, or
at least of some of them, in the Sumerian narrative. Nor does the
existence of a Sumerian form of the Epic necessarily prove that it
originated with the Sumerians in their earliest home before they came
to the Euphrates Valley. They may have adopted it after their conquest
of southern Babylonia from the Semites who, there are now substantial
grounds for believing, were the earlier settlers in the Euphrates
Valley.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e518src" href="#xd26e518" name=
"xd26e518src">18</a> We must distinguish, therefore, between the
earliest <i>literary</i> form, which was undoubtedly Sumerian, and the
<i>origin</i> of the episodes embodied in the Epic, including the chief
actors, Gilgamesh and his companion Enkidu. It will be shown that one
of the chief episodes, the encounter of the two heroes with a powerful
guardian or ruler of a cedar forest, points to a western region, more
specifically to Amurru, as the scene. The names of the two chief
actors, moreover, appear to have been &ldquo;Sumerianized&rdquo; by an
artificial process,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e550src" href="#xd26e550"
name="xd26e550src">19</a> and if this view turns out to be <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="p15" href="#p15" name="p15">15</a>]</span>correct, we
would have a further ground for assuming the tale to have originated
among the Akkadian settlers and to have been taken over from them by
the Sumerians.</p>

<p class="first">New light on the earliest Babylonian version of the
Epic, as well as on the Assyrian version, has been shed by the recovery
of two substantial fragments of the form which the Epic had assumed in
Babylonia in the Hammurabi period. The study of this important new
material also enables us to advance the interpretation of the Epic and
to perfect the analysis into its component parts. In the spring of
1914, the Museum of the University of Pennsylvania acquired by purchase
a large tablet, the writing of which as well as the style and the
manner of spelling verbal forms and substantives pointed distinctly to
the time of the first Babylonian dynasty. The tablet was identified by
Dr. Arno Poebel as part of the Gilgamesh Epic; and, as the colophon
showed, it formed the second tablet of the series. He copied it with a
view to publication, but the outbreak of the war which found him in
Germany&mdash;his native country&mdash;prevented him from carrying out
this intention.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e565src" href="#xd26e565"
name="xd26e565src">20</a> He, however, utilized some of its contents in
his discussion of the historical or semi-historical traditions about
Gilgamesh, as revealed by the important list of partly mythical and
partly historical dynasties, found among the tablets of the Nippur
collection, in which Gilgamesh occurs<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e571src" href="#xd26e571" name="xd26e571src">21</a> as a King of
an Erech dynasty, whose father was &Acirc;, a priest of Kulab.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e581src" href="#xd26e581" name=
"xd26e581src">22</a></p>
<p>The publication of the tablet was then undertaken by Dr. Stephen
Langdon in monograph form under the title, &ldquo;The Epic of
Gilgamish.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e592src" href="#xd26e592"
name="xd26e592src">23</a> In a preliminary article on the tablet in the
<i>Museum Journal</i>, Vol. VIII, pages 29&ndash;38, Dr. Langdon took
the tablet to be of the late <span class="pagenum">[<a id="p16" href=
"#p16" name="p16">16</a>]</span>Persian period (i.e., between the sixth
and third century B. C.), but his attention having been called to this
error of some <i>1500 years</i>, he corrected it in his introduction to
his edition of the text, though he neglected to change some of his
notes in which he still refers to the text as
&ldquo;late.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e607src" href="#xd26e607"
name="xd26e607src">24</a> In addition to a copy of the text,
accompanied by a good photograph, Dr. Langdon furnished a
transliteration and translation with some notes and a brief
introduction. The text is unfortunately badly copied, being full of
errors; and the translation is likewise very defective. A careful
collation with the original tablet was made with the assistance of Dr.
Edward Chiera, and as a consequence we are in a position to offer to
scholars a correct text. We beg to acknowledge our obligations to Dr.
Gordon, the Director of the Museum of the University of Pennsylvania,
for kindly placing the tablet at our disposal. Instead of republishing
the text, I content myself with giving a full list of corrections in
the appendix to this volume which will enable scholars to control our
readings, and which will, I believe, justify the translation in the
numerous passages in which it deviates from Dr. Langdon&rsquo;s
rendering. While credit should be given to Dr. Langdon for having made
this important tablet accessible, the interests of science demand that
attention be called to his failure to grasp the many important data
furnished by the tablet, which escaped him because of his erroneous
readings and faulty translations.</p>
<p>The tablet, consisting of six columns (three on the obverse and
three on the reverse), comprised, according to the colophon, 240
lines<a class="noteref" id="xd26e612src" href="#xd26e612" name=
"xd26e612src">25</a> and formed the second tablet of the series. Of the
total, 204 lines are preserved in full or in part, and of the missing
thirty-six quite a number can be restored, so that we have a fairly
complete tablet. The most serious break occurs at the top of the
reverse, where about eight lines are missing. In consequence of this
the connection between the end of the obverse (where about five lines
are missing) and the beginning of the reverse is obscured, though not
to the extent of our entirely losing the thread of the narrative.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="p17" href="#p17" name=
"p17">17</a>]</span></p>
<p>About the same time that the University of Pennsylvania Museum
purchased this second tablet of the Gilgamesh Series, Yale University
obtained a tablet from the same dealer, which turned out to be a
continuation of the University of Pennsylvania tablet. That the two
belong to the same edition of the Epic is shown by their agreement in
the dark brown color of the clay, in the writing as well as in the size
of the tablet, though the characters on the Yale tablet are somewhat
cramped and in consequence more difficult to read. Both tablets consist
of six columns, three on the obverse and three on the reverse. The
measurements of both are about the same, the Pennsylvania tablet being
estimated at about 7 inches high, as against 7&#8203;2&frasl;16&#8203;
inches for the Yale tablet, while the width of both is 6&frac12;
inches. The Yale tablet is, however, more closely written and therefore
has a larger number of lines than the Pennsylvania tablet. The colophon
to the Yale tablet is unfortunately missing, but from internal evidence
it is quite certain that the Yale tablet follows immediately upon the
Pennsylvania tablet and, therefore, may be set down as the third of the
series. The obverse is very badly preserved, so that only a general
view of its contents can be secured. The reverse contains serious gaps
in the first and second columns. The scribe evidently had a copy before
him which he tried to follow exactly, but finding that he could not get
all of the copy before him in the six columns, he continued the last
column on the edge. In this way we obtain for the sixth column 64 lines
as against 45 for column IV, and 47 for column V, and a total of 292
lines for the six columns. Subtracting the 16 lines written on the edge
leaves us 276 lines for our tablet as against 240 for its companion.
The width of each column being the same on both tablets, the difference
of 36 lines is made up by the closer writing.</p>
<p>Both tablets have peculiar knobs at the sides, the purpose of which
is evidently not to facilitate holding the tablet in one&rsquo;s hand
while writing or reading it, as <span class="corr" id="xd26e635" title=
"Source: Landgon">Langdon</span> assumed<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e638src" href="#xd26e638" name="xd26e638src">26</a> (it would be
quite impracticable for this purpose), but simply to protect the tablet
in its position on a shelf, where it would naturally be placed on the
edge, just as we arrange books on a shelf. Finally be it noted that
these two tablets of the old Babylonian version do not belong to the
same edition as the Meissner tablet above described, for the latter
consists <span class="pagenum">[<a id="p18" href="#p18" name=
"p18">18</a>]</span>of two columns each on obverse and reverse, as
against three columns each in the case of our two tablets. We thus have
the interesting proof that as early as 2000 B.C. there were already
several editions of the Epic. As to the provenance of our two tablets,
there are no definite data, but it is likely that they were found by
natives in the mounds at Warka, from which about the year 1913, many
tablets came into the hands of dealers. It is likely that where two
tablets of a series were found, others of the series were also dug up,
and we may expect to find some further portions of this old Babylonian
version turning up in the hands of other dealers or in museums.</p>

<p class="first">Coming to the contents of the two tablets, the
Pennsylvania tablet deals with the meeting of the two heroes, Gilgamesh
and Enkidu, their conflict, followed by their reconciliation, while the
Yale tablet in continuation takes up the preparations for the encounter
of the two heroes with the guardian of the cedar forest,
&#7722;umbaba&mdash;but probably pronounced &#7722;ubaba<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e650src" href="#xd26e650" name=
"xd26e650src">27</a>&mdash;or, as the name appears in the old
Babylonian version, &#7722;uwawa. The two tablets correspond,
therefore, to portions of Tablets I to V of the Assyrian
version;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e656src" href="#xd26e656" name=
"xd26e656src">28</a> but, as will be shown in detail further on, the
number of <i>completely</i> parallel passages is not large, and the
Assyrian version shows an independence of the old Babylonian version
that is larger than we had reason to expect. In general, it may be said
that the Assyrian version is more elaborate, which points to its having
received its present form at a considerably later period than the old
Babylonian version.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e662src" href="#xd26e662"
name="xd26e662src">29</a> On the other hand, we already find in the
Babylonian version the tendency towards repetition, which is
characteristic of Babylonian-Assyrian tales in general. Through the two
Babylonian tablets we are enabled to fill out certain details
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="p19" href="#p19" name=
"p19">19</a>]</span>of the two episodes with which they deal: (1) the
meeting of Gilgamesh and Enkidu, and (2) the encounter with
&#7722;uwawa; while their greatest value consists in the light that
they throw on the gradual growth of the Epic until it reached its
definite form in the text represented by the fragments in
Ashurbanapal&rsquo;s Library. Let us now take up the detailed analysis,
first of the Pennsylvania tablet and then of the Yale tablet. The
Pennsylvania tablet begins with two dreams recounted by Gilgamesh to
his mother, which the latter interprets as presaging the coming of
Enkidu to Erech. In the one, something like a heavy meteor falls from
heaven upon Gilgamesh and almost crushes him. With the help of the
heroes of Erech, Gilgamesh carries the heavy burden to his mother
Ninsun. The burden, his mother explains, symbolizes some one who, like
Gilgamesh, is born in the mountains, to whom all will pay homage and of
whom Gilgamesh will become enamoured with a love as strong as that for
a woman. In a second dream, Gilgamesh sees some one who is like him,
who brandishes an axe, and with whom he falls in love. This personage,
the mother explains, is again Enkidu.</p>
<p>Langdon is of the opinion that these dreams are recounted to Enkidu
by a woman with whom Enkidu cohabits for six days and seven nights and
who weans Enkidu from association with animals. This, however, cannot
be correct. The scene between Enkidu and the woman must have been
recounted in detail in the first tablet, as in the Assyrian
version,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e679src" href="#xd26e679" name=
"xd26e679src">30</a> whereas here in the second tablet we have the
continuation of the tale with Gilgamesh recounting his dreams directly
to his mother. The story then continues with the description of the
coming of Enkidu, conducted by the woman to the outskirts of Erech,
where food is given him. The main feature of the incident is the
conversion of Enkidu to civilized life. Enkidu, who hitherto had gone
about naked, is clothed by the woman. Instead of sucking milk and
drinking from a trough like an animal, food and strong drink are placed
before him, and he is taught how to eat and drink in human fashion. In
human fashion he also becomes drunk, and his &ldquo;spree&rdquo; is
na&iuml;vely described: &ldquo;His heart became glad and his face
shone.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e682src" href="#xd26e682" name=
"xd26e682src">31</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="p20" href="#p20"
name="p20">20</a>]</span>Like an animal, Enkidu&rsquo;s body had
hitherto been covered with hair, which is now shaved off. He is
anointed with oil, and clothed &ldquo;like a man.&rdquo; Enkidu becomes
a shepherd, protecting the fold against wild beasts, and his exploit in
dispatching lions is briefly told. At this point&mdash;the end of
column 3 (on the obverse), i.e., line 117, and the beginning of column
4 (on the reverse), i.e., line 131&mdash;a gap of 13 lines&mdash;the
tablet is obscure, but apparently the story of Enkidu&rsquo;s gradual
transformation from savagery to civilized life is continued, with
stress upon his introduction to domestic ways with the wife chosen or
decreed for him, and with work as part of his fate. All this has no
connection with Gilgamesh, and it is evident that the tale of Enkidu
was originally an <i>independent</i> tale to illustrate the evolution
of man&rsquo;s career and destiny, how through intercourse with a woman
he awakens to the sense of human dignity, how he becomes accustomed to
the ways of civilization, how he passes through the pastoral stage to
higher walks of life, how the family is instituted, and how men come to
be engaged in the labors associated with human activities. In order to
connect this tale with the Gilgamesh story, the two heroes are brought
together; the woman taking on herself, in addition to the r&ocirc;le of
civilizer, that of the medium through which Enkidu is brought to
Gilgamesh. The woman leads Enkidu from the outskirts of Erech into the
city itself, where the people on seeing him remark upon his likeness to
Gilgamesh. He is the very counterpart of the latter, though somewhat
smaller in stature. There follows the encounter between the two heroes
in the streets of Erech, where they engage in a fierce combat.
Gilgamesh is overcome by Enkidu and is enraged at being thrown to the
ground. The tablet closes with the endeavor of Enkidu to pacify
Gilgamesh. Enkidu declares that the mother of Gilgamesh has exalted her
son above the ordinary mortal, and that Enlil himself has singled him
out for royal prerogatives.</p>
<p>After this, we may assume, the two heroes become friends and
together proceed to carry out certain exploits, the first of which is
an attack upon the mighty guardian of the cedar forest. This is the
main episode in the Yale tablet, which, therefore, forms the third
tablet of the old Babylonian version.</p>
<p>In the first column of the obverse of the Yale tablet, which is
badly preserved, it would appear that the elders of Erech (or perhaps
the people) are endeavoring to dissuade Gilgamesh from making the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="p21" href="#p21" name=
"p21">21</a>]</span>attempt to penetrate to the abode of &#7722;uwawa.
If this is correct, then the close of the first column may represent a
conversation between these elders and the woman who accompanies Enkidu.
It would be the elders who are represented as &ldquo;reporting the
speech to the woman,&rdquo; which is presumably the determination of
Gilgamesh to fight &#7722;uwawa. The elders apparently desire Enkidu to
accompany Gilgamesh in this perilous adventure, and with this in view
appeal to the woman. In the second column after an obscure reference to
the mother of Gilgamesh&mdash;perhaps appealing to the sun-god&mdash;we
find Gilgamesh and Enkidu again face to face. From the reference to
Enkidu&rsquo;s eyes &ldquo;filled with tears,&rdquo; we may conclude
that he is moved to pity at the thought of what will happen to
Gilgamesh if he insists upon carrying out his purpose. Enkidu, also,
tries to dissuade Gilgamesh. This appears to be the main purport of the
dialogue between the two, which begins about the middle of the second
column and extends to the end of the third column. Enkidu pleads that
even his strength is insufficient,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;My arms are lame,</p>
<p class="line">My strength has become weak.&rdquo; (lines
88&ndash;89)</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Gilgamesh apparently asks for a description of the
terrible tyrant who thus arouses the fear of Enkidu, and in reply
Enkidu tells him how at one time, when he was roaming about with the
cattle, he penetrated into the forest and heard the roar of
&#7722;uwawa which was like that of a deluge. The mouth of the tyrant
emitted fire, and his breath was death. It is clear, as Professor Haupt
has suggested,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e703src" href="#xd26e703"
name="xd26e703src">32</a> that Enkidu furnishes the description of a
volcano in eruption, with its mighty roar, spitting forth fire and
belching out a suffocating smoke. Gilgamesh is, however, undaunted and
urges Enkidu to accompany him in the adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go down to the forest,&rdquo; says Gilgamesh, if the
conjectural restoration of the line in question (l. 126) is correct.
Enkidu replies by again drawing a lurid picture of what will happen
&ldquo;When we go (together) to the
forest&#8202;&hellip;&hellip;<span class="corr" id="xd26e708" title=
"Source: &rdquo;.">.&rdquo;</span> This speech of Enkidu is continued
on the reverse. In reply Gilgamesh emphasizes his reliance upon the
good will of Shamash and reproaches Enkidu with cowardice. He declares
himself superior to Enkidu&rsquo;s warning, and in bold terms
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="p22" href="#p22" name=
"p22">22</a>]</span>says that he prefers to perish in the attempt to
overcome &#7722;uwawa rather than abandon it.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Wherever terror is to be faced,</p>
<p class="line">Thou, forsooth, art in fear of death.</p>

<p class="line">Though thy mouth shouts to me: &lsquo;thou art afraid

encounter.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e728src" href="#xd26e728" name=

</div>
<p class="first">They try to frighten Gilgamesh by repeating the
description of the terrible &#7722;uwawa. Gilgamesh is still undaunted
and prays to his patron deity Shamash, who apparently accords him a
favorable &ldquo;oracle&rdquo; (<i>t&ecirc;rtu</i>). The two heroes arm
themselves for the fray, and the elders of Erech, now reconciled to the
perilous undertaking, counsel Gilgamesh to take provision along for the
undertaking. They urge Gilgamesh to allow Enkidu to take the lead,
for</p>

</div>
<p class="first">The elders dismiss Gilgamesh with fervent wishes that
Enkidu may track out the &ldquo;closed path&rdquo; for Gilgamesh, and
commit him to the care of Lugalbanda&mdash;here perhaps an epithet of
Shamash. They advise Gilgamesh to perform certain rites, to wash his
feet in the stream of &#7722;uwawa and to pour out a libation of water
to Shamash. Enkidu follows in a speech likewise intended to encourage
the hero; and with the actual beginning of the expedition against
&#7722;uwawa the tablet ends. The encounter itself, with the triumph of
the two heroes, must have been described in the fourth tablet.

<p class="first">Now before taking up the significance of the additions
to our knowledge of the Epic gained through these two tablets, it will
be well to discuss the forms in which the names of the two heroes and
of the ruler of the cedar forest occur in our tablets.</p>
<p>As in the Meissner fragment, the chief hero is invariably designated
as <sup>d</sup>Gish in both the Pennsylvania and Yale tablets; and we
may therefore conclude that this was the common form in the Hammurabi
period, as against the writing
<sup>d</sup>Gish-g&igrave;(n)-mash<a class="noteref" id="xd26e763src"
href="#xd26e763" name="xd26e763src">34</a> in the Assyrian version.
Similarly, as in the Meissner fragment, the second hero&rsquo;s name is
always written En-ki-d&#361;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e778src" href=
"#xd26e778" name="xd26e778src">35</a> (abbreviated from d&uacute;g) as
against En-ki-d&uacute; in the Assyrian version. Finally, we encounter
in the Yale tablet for the first time the writing &#7722;u-wa-wa as the
name of the guardian of the cedar forest, as against &#7722;um-ba-ba in
the Assyrian version, though in the latter case, as we may now conclude
from the Yale tablet, the name should rather be read
&#7722;u-ba-ba.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e787src" href="#xd26e787"
name="xd26e787src">36</a> The variation in the writing of the latter
name is interesting as pointing to the aspirate pronunciation of the
labial in both instances. The name would thus present a complete
parallel to the Hebrew name &#7722;owawa (or &#7722;obab) who appears
as the brother-in-law of Moses in the P document, Numbers 10,
29.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e791src" href="#xd26e791" name=
"xd26e791src">37</a> Since the name also occurs, written precisely as
in the Yale tablet, among the &ldquo;Amoritic&rdquo; names in the
important lists published by Dr. Chiera,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e797src" href="#xd26e797" name="xd26e797src">38</a> there can be
no doubt that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="p24" href="#p24" name=
"p24">24</a>]</span>&#7722;uwawa or &#7722;ubaba is a West Semitic
name. This important fact adds to the probability that the &ldquo;cedar
forest&rdquo; in which &#7722;uwawa dwells is none other than the
Lebanon district, famed since early antiquity for its cedars. This
explanation of the name &#7722;uwawa disposes of suppositions hitherto
brought forward for an Elamitic origin. Gressmann<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e835src" href="#xd26e835" name="xd26e835src">39</a> still favors
such an origin, though realizing that the description of the cedar
forest points to the Amanus or Lebanon range. In further confirmation
of the West Semitic origin of the name, we have in Lucian, <i>De Dea
Syria</i>, &sect; 19, the name Kombabos<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e850src" href="#xd26e850" name="xd26e850src">40</a> (the guardian
of Stratonika), which forms a perfect parallel to &#7722;u(m)baba. Of
the important bearings of this western character of the name
&#7722;uwawa on the interpretation and origin of the Gilgamesh Epic,
suggesting that the episode of the encounter between the tyrant and the
two heroes rests upon a tradition of an expedition against the West or
Amurru land, we shall have more to say further on.</p>
<p>The variation in the writing of the name Enkidu is likewise
interesting. It is evident that the form in the old Babylonian version
with the sign d&#361; (i.e., d&uacute;g) is the original, for it
furnishes us with a suitable etymology &ldquo;Enki is good.&rdquo; The
writing with d&uacute;g, pronounced d&#363;, also shows that the sign
d&uacute; as the third element in the form which the name has in the
Assyrian version is to be read d&uacute;, and that former readings like
Ea-bani must be definitely abandoned.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e857src" href="#xd26e857" name="xd26e857src">41</a> The form with
d&uacute; is clearly a <i>phonetic</i> writing of the Sumerian name,
the sign d&uacute; being chosen to indicate the <i>pronunciation</i>
(not the ideograph) of the third element d&uacute;g. This is confirmed
by the writing En-gi-d&uacute; in the syllabary <i>CT</i> XVIII, 30,
10. The phonetic writing is, therefore, a warning against any endeavor
to read the name by an Akkadian transliteration of the signs. This
would not of itself prove that Enkidu is of Sumerian <i>origin</i>, for
it might well be that the writing En-ki-d&uacute; is an endeavor to
give a Sumerian <i>aspect</i> to a name that <i>may</i> have been
foreign. The element d&uacute;g corresponds to the Semitic
<i>&#7789;&acirc;bu</i>, &ldquo;good,&rdquo; and En-ki being originally
a designation of a deity as the &ldquo;lord of the land,&rdquo; which
would be the Sumerian <span class="pagenum">[<a id="p25" href="#p25"
name="p25">25</a>]</span>manner of indicating a Semitic Baal, it is not
at all impossible that En-ki-d&uacute;g may be the
&ldquo;Sumerianized&rdquo; form of a Semitic <span lang=
"he">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1500;
&#1496;&#1494;&#1465;&#1489;&lrm;</span> &ldquo;Baal is good.&rdquo; It
will be recalled that in the third column of the Yale tablet, Enkidu
speaks of himself in his earlier period while still living with cattle,
as wandering into the cedar forest of &#7722;uwawa, while in another
passage (ll. 252&ndash;253) he is described as &ldquo;acquainted with
the way &hellip; to the entrance of the forest.&rdquo; This would
clearly point to the West as the original home of Enkidu. We are thus
led once more to Amurru&mdash;taken as a general designation of the
West&mdash;as playing an important role in the Gilgamesh Epic.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e898src" href="#xd26e898" name="xd26e898src">42</a>
If Gilgamesh&rsquo;s expedition against &#7722;uwawa of the Lebanon
district recalls a Babylonian campaign against Amurru, Enkidu&rsquo;s
coming from his home, where, as we read repeatedly in the Assyrian
version,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;He ate herbs with the gazelles,</p>
<p class="line">Drank out of a trough with cattle,&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e911src" href="#xd26e911" name=
"xd26e911src">43</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">may rest on a tradition of an Amorite invasion of
Babylonia. The fight between Gilgamesh and Enkidu would fit in with
this tradition, while the subsequent reconciliation would be the form
in which the tradition would represent the enforced union between the
invaders and the older settlers.</p>
<p>Leaving this aside for the present, let us proceed to a
consideration of the relationship of the form <sup>d</sup>Gish, for the
chief personage in the Epic in the old Babylonian version, to
<sup>d</sup>Gish-gi(n)-mash in the Assyrian version. Of the meaning of
Gish there is fortunately no doubt. It is clearly the equivalent to the
Akkadian <i>zikaru</i>, &ldquo;man&rdquo; (Br&uuml;nnow No. 5707), or
possibly <i>rab&ucirc;</i>, &ldquo;great&rdquo; (Br&uuml;nnow No.
5704). Among various equivalents, the preference is to be given to
<i>itlu</i>, &ldquo;hero.&rdquo; The determinative for deity stamps the
person so designated as deified, or as in part divine, and this is in
accord with the express statement in the Assyrian version of the
Gilgamesh Epic which describes the hero as</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Two-thirds god and one-third
human.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e935src" href="#xd26e935" name=
"xd26e935src">44</a></p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="p26" href="#p26" name=
"p26">26</a>]</span></p>
<p>Gish is, therefore, the hero-god <i>par excellence</i>; and this
shows that we are not dealing with a genuine proper name, but rather
with a descriptive attribute. Proper names are not formed in this way,
either in Sumerian or Akkadian. Now what relation does this form Gish
bear to</p>
<div class="figure cu26-1width"><img src="images/cu26-1.gif" alt=""
width="109" height="20"></div>
<p>as the name of the hero is invariably written in the Assyrian
version, the form which was at first read <sup>d</sup>Iz-tu-bar or
<sup>d</sup>Gish-du-bar by scholars, until Pinches found in a
neo-Babylonian syllabary<a class="noteref" id="xd26e955src" href=
"#xd26e955" name="xd26e955src">45</a> the equation of it with
Gi-il-ga-mesh? Pinches&rsquo; discovery pointed conclusively to the
popular pronunciation of the hero&rsquo;s name as Gilgamesh; and since
Aelian (<i lang="la">De natura Animalium</i> XII, 2) mentions a
Babylonian personage Gilgamos (though what he tells us of Gilgamos does
not appear in our Epic, but seems to apply to Etana, another figure of
Babylonian mythology), there seemed to be no further reason to question
that the problem had been solved. Besides, in a later Syriac list of
Babylonian kings found in the Scholia of Theodor bar Koni, the name
<span lang="he">&#1490;&#1500;&#1502;&#1490;&#1493;&#1501;&lrm;</span>
with a variant <span lang=
"he">&#1490;&#1502;&#1497;&#1490;&#1502;&#1493;&#1505;&lrm;</span>
occurs,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e973src" href="#xd26e973" name=
"xd26e973src">46</a> and it is evident that we have here again the
Gi-il-ga-mesh, discovered by Pinches. The existence of an old
Babylonian hero Gilgamesh who was likewise a king is thus established,
as well as his identification with</p>
<div class="figure cu26-2width"><img src="images/cu26-1.gif" alt=""
width="109" height="20"></div>
<p>It is evident that we cannot read this name as Iz-tu-bar or
Gish-du-bar, but that we must read the first sign as Gish and the third
as Mash, while for the second we must assume a reading G&igrave;n or
Gi. This would give us Gish-g&igrave;(n)-mash which is clearly again
(like En-ki-d&uacute;) not an etymological writing but a
<i>phonetic</i> one, intended to convey an <i>approach</i> to the
popular pronunciation. Gi-il-ga-mesh might well be merely a variant for
Gish-ga-mesh, or <i>vice versa</i>, and this would come close to
Gish-gi-mash. Now, when we have a name the pronunciation of which is
not definite but approximate, and which is written in various ways, the
probabilities are that the name is foreign. A foreign name might
naturally be spelled in various ways. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"p27" href="#p27" name="p27">27</a>]</span>Epic in the Assyrian version
clearly depicts <sup>d</sup>Gish-g&igrave;(n)-mash as a conqueror of
Erech, who forces the people into subjection, and whose autocratic rule
leads the people of Erech to implore the goddess Aruru to create a
rival to him who may withstand him. In response to this appeal
<sup>d</sup>Enkidu is formed out of dust by Aruru and eventually
brought to Erech.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1016src" href="#xd26e1016"
name="xd26e1016src">47</a> Gish-g&igrave;(n)-mash or Gilgamesh is
therefore in all probability a foreigner; and the simplest solution
suggested by the existence of the two forms (1) Gish in the old
Babylonian version and (2) Gish-g&igrave;(n)-mash in the Assyrian
version, is to regard the former as an abbreviation, which seemed
appropriate, because the short name conveyed the idea of the
&ldquo;hero&rdquo; <i>par excellence</i>. If Gish-g&igrave;(n)-mash is
a foreign name, one would think in the first instance of Sumerian; but
here we encounter a difficulty in the circumstance that outside of the
Epic this conqueror and ruler of Erech appears in quite a different
form, namely, as <sup>d</sup>Gish-bil-ga-mesh, with
<sup>d</sup>Gish-gibil(or b&igrave;l)-ga-mesh and
<sup>d</sup>Gish-bil-ge-mesh as variants.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1032src" href="#xd26e1032" name="xd26e1032src">48</a> In the
remarkable list of partly mythological and partly historical dynasties,

dynasty of Erech appears as <sup>d</sup>Gish-bil-ga-mesh; and similarly
in an inscription of the days of Sin-gamil,

Erech.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1056src" href="#xd26e1056" name=
"xd26e1056src">50</a> Moreover, in the several fragments of the
Sumerian version of the Epic we have invariably the form
<sup>d</sup>Gish-bil-ga-mesh. It is evident, therefore, that this is
the genuine form of the name in Sumerian and presumably, therefore, the
oldest form. By way of further confirmation we have in the syllabary
above referred to, CT, XVIII, 30, 6&ndash;8, three designations of our
hero, viz:</p>
<ul>
<li><sup>d</sup>Gish-gibil(or b&iacute;l)-ga-mesh</li>
<li><i>mu&#7731;-tab-lu</i> (&ldquo;warrior&rdquo;)</li>
<li><i>a-lik pa-na</i> (&ldquo;leader&rdquo;)</li>

<p class="first">The variant Gish-gibil for Gish-bil may be disposed of
readily, in view of the frequent confusion or interchange of the two
signs Bil (Br&uuml;nnow No. 4566) and Gibil or B&iacute;l (Br&uuml;nnow
No. 4642) which has also the value Gi (Br&uuml;nnow 4641), so that we
might also read Gish-gi-ga-mesh. Both signs convey the idea of
&ldquo;fire,&rdquo; &ldquo;renew,&rdquo; etc.; both revert to the
picture of flames of fire, in the one case with a bowl (or some such
obiect) above it, in the other the flames issuing apparently from a
torch.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1151src" href="#xd26e1151" name=
"xd26e1151src">55</a> The meaning of the name is not affected whether
we read <sup>d</sup>Gish-bil-ga-mesh or <sup>d</sup>Gish-gibil(or
b&iacute;l)-ga-mesh, for the middle element in the latter case being
identical with the fire-god, written <sup>d</sup>Bil-gi and to be
pronounced in the inverted form as Gibil with <i>-ga</i> (or <i>ge</i>)
as the phonetic complement; it is equivalent, therefore, to the writing
bil-ga in the former case. Now Gish-gibil or Gish-b&iacute;l conveys
the idea of <i>abu</i>, &ldquo;father&rdquo; (Br&uuml;nnow No. 5713),
just as Bil (Br&uuml;nnow No. 4579) has this meaning, while
Pa-gibil-(ga) or Pa-b&iacute;l-ga is <i>abu abi</i>,
&ldquo;grandfather.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1184src" href=
"#xd26e1184" name="xd26e1184src">56</a> This meaning may be derived
from Gibil, as also from B&iacute;l = <i>i&scaron;atu</i>,
&ldquo;fire,&rdquo; then <i>e&scaron;&scaron;u</i>, &ldquo;new,&rdquo;
then <i>abu</i>, &ldquo;father,&rdquo; as the renewer or creator. Gish
with B&iacute;l or Gibil would, therefore, be &ldquo;the
father-man&rdquo; or &ldquo;the father-hero,&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="p29" href="#p29" name="p29">29</a>]</span>i.e., again
the hero <i>par excellence</i>, the original hero, just as in Hebrew
and Arabic <i>ab</i> is used in this way.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1211src" href="#xd26e1211" name="xd26e1211src">57</a> The
syllable <i>ga</i> being a phonetic complement, the element <i>mesh</i>
is to be taken by itself and to be explained, as Poebel suggested, as
&ldquo;hero&rdquo; (<i>itlu</i>. Br&uuml;nnow No. 5967).</p>
<p>We would thus obtain an entirely artificial combination, &ldquo;man
(or hero), father, hero,&rdquo; which would simply convey in an
emphatic manner the idea of the <i>Ur-held</i>, the original hero, the
father of heroes as it were&mdash;practically the same idea, therefore,
as the one conveyed by Gish alone, as the hero <i>par excellence</i>.
Our investigation thus leads us to a substantial identity between Gish
and the longer form Gish-bil(or b&iacute;l)-ga-mesh, and the former
might, therefore, well be used as an abbreviation of the latter. Both
the shorter and the longer forms are <i>descriptive epithets</i> based
on naive folk etymology, rather than personal names, just as in the
designation of our hero as <i lang="obab">mu&#7731;tablu</i>, the
&ldquo;fighter,&rdquo; or as <i lang="obab">&acirc;lik p&acirc;na</i>,
&ldquo;the leader,&rdquo; or as <i lang="obab">Esigga imin</i>,
&ldquo;the seven-fold hero,&rdquo; or <i lang="obab">Esigga tuk</i>,
&ldquo;the one who is a hero,&rdquo; are descriptive epithets, and as
Atra-&#7723;asis, &ldquo;the very wise one,&rdquo; is such an epithet
for the hero of the deluge story. The case is different with
Gi-il-ga-mesh, or Gish-g&igrave;(n)-mash, which represent the popular
and actual pronunciation of the name, or at least the <i>approach</i>
to such pronunciation. Such forms, stripped as they are of all
artificiality, impress one as genuine names. The conclusion to which we
are thus led is that Gish-bil(or b&iacute;l)-ga-mesh is a play upon the
genuine name, to convey to those to whom the real name, as that of a
foreigner, would suggest no meaning an interpretation <i>fitting in
with his character</i>. In other words, Gish-bil-ga-mesh is a
&ldquo;Sumerianized&rdquo; form of the name, introduced into the
Sumerian version of the tale which became a folk-possession in the
Euphrates Valley. Such plays upon names to suggest the character of an
individual or some incident are familiar to us from the narratives in
Genesis.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1257src" href="#xd26e1257" name=

complimentary or appropriate.</p>
<p>In this way, an artificial division and at the same time a
distortion of a foreign name like Gilgamesh into several elements,
Gish-bil-ga-mesh, is no more violent than, for example, the explanation
of Issachar or rather Issaschar as &ldquo;God has given my hire&rdquo;

as though the name were to be divided into <i>Yah</i>
(&ldquo;God&rdquo;) and <i>s<sup>e</sup>char</i> (&ldquo;hire&rdquo;);
or the popular name of Alexander among the Arabs as <i>Zu&rsquo;l
Karnaini</i>, &ldquo;the possessor of the two horns.&rdquo; with a
suggestion of his conquest of two hemispheres, or what not.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1305src" href="#xd26e1305" name=
"xd26e1305src">59</a> The element Gil in Gilgamesh would be regarded as
a contraction of Gish-bil or gi-bil, in order to furnish the meaning
&ldquo;father-hero,&rdquo; or Gil might be looked upon as a variant for
Gish, which would give us the &ldquo;phonetic&rdquo; form in the
Assyrian version <sup>d</sup>Gish-gi-mash,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1317src" href="#xd26e1317" name="xd26e1317src">60</a> as well as
such a variant writing <sup>d</sup>Gish-gi-mas-(si). Now a name like
Gilgamesh, upon which we may definitely settle as coming closest to the
genuine form, certainly impresses one as foreign, i.e., it is neither
Sumerian nor Akkadian; and we have already suggested that the
circumstance that the hero of the Epic is portrayed as a conqueror of
Erech, and a rather ruthless one at that, points to a tradition of an
invasion of the Euphrates Valley as the background for the episode in
the first tablet of the series. Now it is significant that many of the
names in the &ldquo;mythical&rdquo; dynasties, as they appear in
Poebel&rsquo;s list,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1323src" href=
"#xd26e1323" name="xd26e1323src">61</a> are likewise foreign, such as
Mes-ki-in-ga-&scaron;e-ir, son of the god Shamash (and the founder of
the &ldquo;mythical&rdquo; dynasty of Erech of which
<sup>d</sup>Gish-bil-ga-mesh is the fifth member),<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e1333src" href="#xd26e1333" name="xd26e1333src">62</a> and
En-me-ir-k&aacute;r his son. In a still earlier &ldquo;mythical&rdquo;
dynasty, we encounter names like Ga-lu-mu-um, Zu-ga-gi-ib, Ar-pi,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="p31" href="#p31" name=
"p31">31</a>]</span>E-ta-na,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1345src" href=
"#xd26e1345" name="xd26e1345src">63</a> which are distinctly foreign,
while such names as En-me(n)-nun-na and Bar-sal-nun-na strike one again
as &ldquo;Sumerianized&rdquo; names rather than as genuine Sumerian
formations.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1351src" href="#xd26e1351" name=
"xd26e1351src">64</a></p>
<p>Some of these names, as Galumum, Arpi and Etana, are so Amoritic in
appearance, that one may hazard the conjecture of their western origin.
May Gilgamesh likewise belong to the Amurru<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1363src" href="#xd26e1363" name="xd26e1363src">65</a> region, or
does he represent a foreigner from the East in contrast to Enkidu,
whose name, we have seen, may have been Baal-&#7788;&ocirc;b in the
West, with which region he is according to the Epic so familiar? It
must be confessed that the second element <i>ga-mesh</i> would fit in
well with a Semitic origin for the name, for the element impresses one
as the participial form of a Semitic stem g-m-&scaron;, just as in the
second element of Meskin-ga&scaron;er we have such a form. Gil might
then be the name of a West-Semitic deity. Such conjectures, however,
can for the present not be substantiated, and we must content ourselves
with the conclusion that Gilgamesh as the real name of the hero, or at
least the form which comes closest to the real name, points to a
foreign origin for the hero, and that such forms as
<sup>d</sup>Gish-bil-ga-mesh and <sup>d</sup>Gish-b&iacute;l-gi-mesh
and other variants are &ldquo;Sumerianized&rdquo; forms for which an
artificial etymology was brought forward to convey the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="p32" href="#p32" name="p32">32</a>]</span>idea of the
&ldquo;original hero&rdquo; or the hero <i>par excellence</i>. By means
of this &ldquo;play&rdquo; on the name, which reverts to the compilers
of the Sumerian version of the Epic, Gilgamesh was converted into a
Sumerian figure, just as the name Enkidu may have been introduced as a
Sumerian translation of his Amoritic name. <sup>d</sup>Gish at all
events is an abbreviated form of the &ldquo;Sumerianized&rdquo; name,
introduced by the compilers of the earliest Akkadian version, which was
produced naturally under the influence of the Sumerian version. Later,
as the Epic continued to grow, a phonetic writing was introduced,
<sup>d</sup>Gish-gi-mash, which is in a measure a compromise between
the genuine name and the &ldquo;Sumerianized&rdquo; form, but at the
same time an <i>approach</i> to the real pronunciation.</p>

<p class="first">Next to the new light thrown upon the names and
original character of the two main figures of the Epic, one of the
chief points of interest in the Pennsylvania fragment is the proof that
it furnishes for a striking resemblance of the two heroes, Gish and
Enkidu, to one another. In interpreting the dream of Gish, his mother.
Ninsun, lays stress upon the fact that the dream portends the coming of
someone who is like Gish, &ldquo;born in the field and reared in the
mountain&rdquo; (lines 18&ndash;19). Both, therefore, are shown by this
description to have come to Babylonia from a mountainous region, i.e.,
they are foreigners; and in the case of Enkidu we have seen that the
mountain in all probability refers to a region in the West, while the
same may also be the case with Gish. The resemblance of the two heroes
to one another extends to their personal appearance. When Enkidu
appears on the streets of Erech, the people are struck by this
resemblance. They remark that he is &ldquo;like Gish,&rdquo; though
&ldquo;shorter in stature&rdquo; (lines 179&ndash;180). Enkidu is
described as a rival or counterpart.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1429src" href="#xd26e1429" name="xd26e1429src">66</a></p>
<p>This relationship between the two is suggested also by the Assyrian
version. In the creation of Enkidu by Aruru, the people urge the
goddess to create the &ldquo;counterpart&rdquo; (<i>zikru</i>) of
Gilgamesh, someone who will be like him (<i>ma-&scaron;i-il</i>)
(Tablet I, 2, 31). Enkidu not only comes from the mountain,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1442src" href="#xd26e1442" name=
"xd26e1442src">67</a> but the mountain is specifically designated
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="p33" href="#p33" name=
"p33">33</a>]</span>as his birth-place (I, 4, 2), precisely as in the
Pennsylvania tablet, while in another passage he is also described, as
in our tablet, as &ldquo;born in the field.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e1447src" href="#xd26e1447" name="xd26e1447src">68</a> Still
more significant is the designation of Gilgamesh as the <i lang=
"obab">talimu</i>, &ldquo;younger brother,&rdquo; of Enkidu.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1454src" href="#xd26e1454" name=
"xd26e1454src">69</a> In accord with this, we find Gilgamesh in his
lament over Enkidu describing him as a &ldquo;younger brother&rdquo;
(<i lang="obab">ku-ta-ni</i>);<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1460src"
href="#xd26e1460" name="xd26e1460src">70</a> and again in the last
tablet of the Epic, Gilgamesh is referred to as the
&ldquo;brother&rdquo; of Enkidu.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1463src"
href="#xd26e1463" name="xd26e1463src">71</a> This close relationship
reverts to the Sumerian version, for the Constantinople fragment
(Langdon, above, p. 13) begins with the designation of Gish-bil-ga-mesh
as &ldquo;his brother.&rdquo; By &ldquo;his&rdquo; no doubt Enkidu is
meant. Likewise in the Sumerian text published by Zimmern (above, p.
13) Gilgamesh appears as the brother of Enkidu (rev. 1, 17).</p>
<p>Turning to the numerous representations of Gilgamesh and Enkidu on
Seal Cylinders,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1468src" href="#xd26e1468"
name="xd26e1468src">72</a> we find this resemblance of the two heroes
to each other strikingly confirmed. Both are represented as bearded,
with the strands arranged in the same fashion. The face in both cases
is broad, with curls protruding at the side of the head, though at
times these curls are lacking in the case of Enkidu. What is
particularly striking is to find Gilgamesh generally <i>a little
taller</i> than Enkidu, thus bearing out the statement in the
Pennsylvania tablet that Enkidu is &ldquo;shorter in stature.&rdquo;
There are, to be sure, also some distinguishing marks between the two.
Thus Enkidu is generally represented with animal hoofs, but not
always.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1484src" href="#xd26e1484" name=
"xd26e1484src">73</a> Enkidu is commonly portrayed with the horns of a
bison, but again this sign is wanting in quite a number of
instances.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1487src" href="#xd26e1487" name=
"xd26e1487src">74</a> The hoofs and the horns mark the period when
Enkidu lived with animals and much like an <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="p34" href="#p34" name="p34">34</a>]</span>animal.
Most remarkable, however, of all are cylinders on which we find the two
heroes almost exactly alike as, for example, Ward No. 199 where two
figures, the one a duplicate of the other (except that one is just a
shade taller), are in conflict with each other. Dr. Ward was puzzled by
this representation and sets it down as a &ldquo;fantastic&rdquo; scene
in which &ldquo;each Gilgamesh is stabbing the other.&rdquo; In the
light of the Pennsylvania tablet, this scene is clearly the conflict
between the two heroes described in column 6, preliminary to their
forming a friendship. Even in the realm of myth the human experience
holds good that there is nothing like a good fight as a basis for a
subsequent alliance. The fragment describes this conflict as a furious
one in which Gilgamesh is worsted, and his wounded pride assuaged by
the generous victor, who comforts his vanquished enemy by the assurance
that he was destined for something higher than to be a mere
&ldquo;Hercules.&rdquo; He was singled out for the exercise of royal
authority. True to the description of the two heroes in the
Pennsylvania tablet as alike, one the counterpart of the other, the
seal cylinder portrays them almost exactly alike, as alike as two
brothers could possibly be; with just enough distinction to make it
clear on close inspection that two figures are intended and not one
repeated for the sake of symmetry. There are slight variations in the
manner in which the hair is worn, and slightly varying expressions of
the face, just enough to make it evident that the one is intended for
Gilgamesh and the other for Enkidu. When, therefore, in another
specimen, No. 173, we find a Gilgamesh holding his counterpart by the
legs, it is merely another aspect of the fight between the two heroes,
one of whom is intended to represent Enkidu, and not, as Dr. Ward
supposed, a grotesque repetition of Gilgamesh.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1493src" href="#xd26e1493" name="xd26e1493src">75</a></p>
<p>The description of Enkidu in the Pennsylvania tablet as a parallel
figure to Gilgamesh leads us to a consideration of the relationship of
the two figures to one another. Many years ago it was pointed out that
the Gilgamesh Epic was a composite tale in which various stories of an
independent origin had been combined and brought into more or less
artificial connection with the <i>heros eponymos</i> of southern
Babylonia.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1501src" href="#xd26e1501" name=
"xd26e1501src">76</a> We may now go a step further and point out that
not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="p35" href="#p35" name=
"p35">35</a>]</span>only is Enkidu originally an entirely independent
figure, having no connection with Gish or Gilgamesh, but that the
latter is really depicted in the Epic as the counterpart of Enkidu, a
reflection who has been given the traits of extraordinary physical
power that belong to Enkidu. This is shown in the first place by the
fact that in the encounter it is Enkidu who triumphs over Gilgamesh.
The entire analysis of the episode of the meeting between the two
heroes as given by Gressmann<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1513src" href=
"#xd26e1513" name="xd26e1513src">77</a> must be revised. It is not
Enkidu who is terrified and who is warned against the encounter. It is
Gilgamesh who, during the night on his way from the house in which the
goddess Ish&#7723;ara lies, encounters Enkidu on the highway. Enkidu
&ldquo;blocks the path&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1522src" href=
"#xd26e1522" name="xd26e1522src">78</a> of Gilgamesh. He prevents
Gilgamesh from re-entering the house,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1526src" href="#xd26e1526" name="xd26e1526src">79</a> and the two
attack each other &ldquo;like oxen.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1529src" href="#xd26e1529" name="xd26e1529src">80</a> They
grapple with each other, and Enkidu forces Gilgamesh to the ground.
Enkidu is, therefore, the real hero whose traits of physical prowess
are afterwards transferred to Gilgamesh.</p>
<p>Similarly in the next episode, the struggle against &#7722;uwawa,
the Yale tablet makes it clear that in the original form of the tale
Enkidu is the real hero. All warn Gish against the
undertaking&mdash;the elders of Erech, Enkidu, and also the workmen.
&ldquo;Why dost thou desire to do this?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1534src" href="#xd26e1534" name="xd26e1534src">81</a> they say to
him. &ldquo;Thou art young, and thy heart carries thee away. Thou
knowest not what thou proposest to do.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1537src" href="#xd26e1537" name="xd26e1537src">82</a> This part
of the incident is now better known to us through the latest fragment
of the Assyrian version discovered and published by King.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1540src" href="#xd26e1540" name=
"xd26e1540src">83</a> The elders say to Gilgamesh:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Do not trust, O Gilgamesh, in thy strength!</p>

name="p36">36</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">Let Enkidu go before thee.</p>
<p class="line">He knows the roads to the cedar forest;</p>
<p class="line">He is skilled in battle and has seen fight.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Gilgamesh is sufficiently impressed by this warning to
invite Enkidu to accompany him on a visit to his mother, Ninsun, for
the purpose of receiving her counsel.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1575src" href="#xd26e1575" name="xd26e1575src">86</a></p>
<p>It is only after Enkidu, who himself hesitates and tries to dissuade
Gish, decides to accompany the latter that the elders of Erech are
reconciled and encourage Gish for the fray. The two in concert proceed
against &#7722;uwawa. Gilgamesh alone cannot carry out the plan. Now
when a tale thus associates two figures in one deed, one of the two has
been added to the original tale. In the present case there can be
little doubt that Enkidu, without whom Gish cannot proceed, who is
specifically described as &ldquo;acquainted with the way &hellip; to
the entrance of the forest<span class="corr" id="xd26e1583" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span><a class="noteref" id="xd26e1585src"
href="#xd26e1585" name="xd26e1585src">87</a> in which &#7722;uwawa
dwells is the <i>original</i> vanquisher. Naturally, the Epic aims to
conceal this fact as much as possible <i>ad majorem gloriam</i> of
Gilgamesh. It tries to put the one who became the favorite hero into
the foreground. Therefore, in both the Babylonian and the Assyrian
version Enkidu is represented as hesitating, and Gilgamesh as
determined to go ahead. Gilgamesh, in fact, accuses Enkidu of cowardice
and boldly declares that he will proceed even though failure stare him
in the face.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1597src" href="#xd26e1597"
name="xd26e1597src">88</a> Traces of the older view, however, in which
Gilgamesh is the one for whom one fears the outcome, crop out; as, for
example, in the complaint of Gilgamesh&rsquo;s mother to Shamash that
the latter has stirred the heart of her son to take the distant way to
&#7722;u(m)baba,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;To a fight unknown to him, he advances,</p>

"#xd26e1607" name="xd26e1607src">89</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">Ninsun evidently fears the consequences when her son
informs her of his intention and asks her counsel. The answer of
Shamash is not preserved, but no doubt it was of a reassuring
character, as was the answer of the Sun-god to Gish&rsquo;s appeal and
prayer as set forth in the Yale tablet.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1614src" href="#xd26e1614" name="xd26e1614src">90</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="p37" href="#p37" name=
"p37">37</a>]</span></p>
<p>Again, as a further indication that Enkidu is the real conqueror of
&#7722;uwawa, we find the coming contest revealed to Enkidu no less
than three times in dreams, which Gilgamesh interprets.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1621src" href="#xd26e1621" name=
"xd26e1621src">91</a> Since the person who dreams is always the one to
whom the dream applies, we may see in these dreams a further trace of
the primary r&ocirc;le originally assigned to Enkidu.</p>
<p>Another exploit which, according to the Assyrian version, the two
heroes perform in concert is the killing of a bull, sent by Anu at the
instance of Ishtar to avenge an insult offered to the goddess by
Gilgamesh, who rejects her offer of marriage. In the fragmentary
description of the contest with the bull, we find Enkidu
&ldquo;seizing&rdquo; the monster by &ldquo;its tail.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1626src" href="#xd26e1626" name=
"xd26e1626src">92</a></p>
<p>That Enkidu originally played the part of the slayer is also shown
by the statement that it is he who insults Ishtar by throwing a piece
of the carcass into the goddess&rsquo; face,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1631src" href="#xd26e1631" name="xd26e1631src">93</a> adding also
an insulting speech; and this despite the fact that Ishtar in her rage
accuses Gilgamesh of killing the bull.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1634src" href="#xd26e1634" name="xd26e1634src">94</a> It is thus
evident that the Epic alters the original character of the episodes in
order to find a place for Gilgamesh, with the further desire to assign
to the latter the <i>chief</i> r&ocirc;le. Be it noted also that
Enkidu, not Gilgamesh, is punished for the insult to Ishtar. Enkidu
must therefore in the original form of the episode have been the guilty
party, who is stricken with mortal disease as a punishment to which
after twelve days he succumbs.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1640src"
href="#xd26e1640" name="xd26e1640src">95</a> In view of this, we may
supply the name of Enkidu in the little song introduced at the close of
the encounter with the bull, and not Gilgamesh as has hitherto been
done.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Who is distinguished among the heroes?</p>
<p class="line">Who is glorious among men?</p>
<p class="line">[Enkidu] is distinguished among heroes,</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="p38" href="#p38" name=

<p>Finally, the killing of lions is directly ascribed to Enkidu in the
Pennsylvania tablet:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Lions he attacked</p>
<p class="line">
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>
<p class="line">Lions he overcame&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1664src" href="#xd26e1664" name="xd26e1664src">97</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">whereas Gilgamesh appears to be afraid of lions. On
his long search for Utnapishtim he says:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;On reaching the entrance of the mountain at
night</p>
<p class="line">I saw lions and was afraid.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e1673src" href="#xd26e1673" name="xd26e1673src">98</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">He prays to Sin and Ishtar to protect and save him.
When, therefore, in another passage some one celebrates Gilgamesh as
the one who overcame the &ldquo;guardian,&rdquo; who dispatched
&#7722;u(m)baba in the cedar forest, who killed lions and overthrew the
bull,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1677src" href="#xd26e1677" name=
"xd26e1677src">99</a> we have the completion of the process which
transferred to Gilgamesh exploits and powers which originally belonged
to Enkidu, though ordinarily the process stops short at making
Gilgamesh a <i>sharer</i> in the exploits; with the natural tendency,
to be sure, to enlarge the share of the favorite.</p>
<p>We can now understand why the two heroes are described in the
Pennsylvania tablet as alike, as born in the same place, aye, as
brothers. Gilgamesh in the Epic is merely a reflex of Enkidu. The
latter is the real hero and presumably, therefore, the older
figure.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1685src" href="#xd26e1685" name=
"xd26e1685src">100</a> Gilgamesh resembles Enkidu, because he <i>is</i>
originally Enkidu. The &ldquo;resemblance&rdquo; <i>motif</i> is merely
the manner in which in the course of the partly popular, partly
literary transfer, the recollection is preserved that Enkidu is the
original, and Gilgamesh the copy.</p>
<p>The artificiality of the process which brings the two heroes
together is apparent in the dreams of Gilgamesh which are interpreted
by his mother as portending the coming of Enkidu. Not the conflict is
foreseen, but the subsequent close association, na&iuml;vely described
as due to the personal charm which Enkidu exercises, which will lead
Gilgamesh to fall in love with the one whom he is to meet. The two will
become one, like man and wife. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="p39" href=
"#p39" name="p39">39</a>]</span></p>
<p>On the basis of our investigations, we are now in a position to
reconstruct in part the cycle of episodes that once formed part of an
Enkidu Epic. The fight between Enkidu and Gilgamesh, in which the
former is the victor, is typical of the kind of tales told of Enkidu.
He is the real prototype of the Greek Hercules. He slays lions, he
overcomes a powerful opponent dwelling in the forests of Lebanon, he
kills the bull, and he finally succumbs to disease sent as a punishment
by an angry goddess. The death of Enkidu naturally formed the close of
the Enkidu Epic, which in its original form may, of course, have
included other exploits besides those taken over into the Gilgamesh
Epic.</p>
</div>

<div class="div2 section">

<h3 class="label">VII.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is another aspect of the figure of Enkidu which
is brought forward in the Pennsylvania tablet more clearly than had
hitherto been the case. Many years ago attention was called to certain
striking resemblances between Enkidu and the figure of the first man as
described in the early chapters of Genesis.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1711src" href="#xd26e1711" name="xd26e1711src">101</a> At that
time we had merely the Assyrian version of the Gilgamesh Epic at our
disposal, and the main point of contact was the description of Enkidu
living with the animals, drinking and feeding like an animal, until a
woman is brought to him with whom he engages in sexual intercourse.
This suggested that Enkidu was a picture of primeval man, while the
woman reminded one of Eve, who when she is brought to Adam becomes his
helpmate and inseparable companion. The Biblical tale stands, of
course, on a much higher level, and is introduced, as are other
traditions and tales of primitive times, in the style of a parable to
convey certain religious teachings. For all that, suggestions of
earlier conceptions crop out in the picture of Adam surrounded by
animals to which he assigns names. Such a phrase as &ldquo;there was no
helpmate corresponding to him&rdquo; becomes intelligible on the
supposition of an existing tradition or belief, that man once lived
and, indeed, cohabited with animals. The tales in the early chapters of
Genesis must rest on very early popular traditions, which have been
cleared of mythological and other objectionable features in order to
adapt them to the purpose of the Hebrew compilers, to serve as a medium
for illustrating <span class="pagenum">[<a id="p40" href="#p40" name=
"p40">40</a>]</span>certain religious teachings regarding man&rsquo;s
place in nature and his higher destiny. From the resemblance between
Enkidu and Adam it does not, of course, follow that the latter is
modelled upon the former, but only that both rest on similar traditions
of the condition under which men lived in primeval days prior to the
beginnings of human culture.</p>
<p>We may now pass beyond these general indications and recognize in
the story of Enkidu as revealed by the Pennsylvania tablet an attempt
to trace the evolution of primitive man from low beginnings to the
regular and orderly family life associated with advanced culture. The
new tablet furnishes a further illustration for the surprisingly early
tendency among the Babylonian <i>literati</i> to connect with popular
tales teachings of a religious or ethical character. Just as the
episode between Gilgamesh and the maiden Sabitum is made the occasion
for introducing reflections on the inevitable fate of man to encounter
death, so the meeting of Enkidu with the woman becomes the medium of
impressing the lesson of human progress through the substitution of
bread and wine for milk and water, through the institution of the
family, and through work and the laying up of resources. This is the
significance of the address to Enkidu in column 4 of the Pennsylvania
tablet, even though certain expressions in it are somewhat obscure. The
connection of the entire episode of Enkidu and the woman with Gilgamesh
is very artificial; and it becomes much more intelligible if we
disassociate it from its present entanglement in the Epic. In
Gilgamesh&rsquo;s dream, portending the meeting with Enkidu, nothing is
said of the woman who is the companion of the latter. The passage in
which Enkidu is created by Aruru to oppose Gilgamesh<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e1727src" href="#xd26e1727" name="xd26e1727src">102</a> betrays
evidence of having been worked over in order to bring Enkidu into
association with the longing of the people of Erech to get rid of a
tyrannical character. The people in their distress appeal to Aruru to
create a rival to Gilgamesh. In response,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Aruru upon hearing this created a man of Anu in
her heart.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Now this &ldquo;man of Anu&rdquo; cannot possibly be
Enkidu, for the sufficient reason that a few lines further on Enkidu is
described as an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="p41" href="#p41" name=
"p41">41</a>]</span>offspring of Ninib. Moreover, the being created is
not a &ldquo;counterpart&rdquo; of Gilgamesh, but an animal-man, as the
description that follows shows. We must separate lines 30&ndash;33 in
which the creation of the &ldquo;Anu man&rdquo; is described from lines
34&ndash;41 in which the creation of Enkidu is narrated. Indeed, these
lines strike one as the proper <i>beginning</i> of the original Enkidu
story, which would naturally start out with his birth and end with his
death. The description is clearly an account of the creation of the
first man, in which capacity Enkidu is brought forward.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Aruru washed her hands, broke off clay,</p>
<p class="line">threw it on the field<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1745src" href="#xd26e1745" name="xd26e1745src">103</a></p>
<p class="line">&hellip; created Enkidu, the hero, a lofty</p>
<p class="line">offspring of the host of Ninib.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1752src" href="#xd26e1752" name=
"xd26e1752src">104</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">The description of Enkidu follows, with his body
covered with hair like an animal, and eating and drinking with the
animals. There follows an episode<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1759src"
href="#xd26e1759" name="xd26e1759src">105</a> which has no connection
whatsoever with the Gilgamesh Epic, but which is clearly intended to
illustrate how Enkidu came to abandon the life with the animals. A
hunter sees Enkidu and is amazed at the strange sight&mdash;an animal
and yet a man. Enkidu, as though resenting his condition, becomes
enraged at the sight of the hunter, and the latter goes to his father
and tells him of the strange creature whom he is unable to catch. In
reply, the father advises his son to take a woman with him when next he
goes out on his pursuit, and to have the woman remove her dress in the
presence of Enkidu, who will then approach her, and after intercourse
with her will abandon the animals among whom he lives. By this device
he will catch the strange creature. Lines 14&ndash;18 of column 3 in
the first tablet in which the father of the hunter refers to Gilgamesh
must be regarded as a later insertion, a part of the reconstruction of
the tale to connect the episode with Gilgamesh. The advice of the
father to his son, the hunter, begins, line 19,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Go my hunter, take with thee a woman.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="p42" href="#p42" name=
"p42">42</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the reconstructed tale, the father tells his son to go to
Gilgamesh to relate to him the strange appearance of the animal-man;
but there is clearly no purpose in this, as is shown by the fact that
when the hunter does so, Gilgamesh makes <i>precisely the same
speech</i> as does the father of the hunter. Lines 40&ndash;44 of
column 3, in which Gilgamesh is represented as speaking to the hunter
form a complete <i>doublet</i> to lines 19&ndash;24, beginning</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Go, my hunter, take with thee a woman,
etc.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">and similarly the description of Enkidu appears twice,
lines 2&ndash;12 in an address of the hunter to his father, and lines
29&ndash;39 in the address of the hunter to Gilgamesh.</p>
<p>The artificiality of the process of introducing Gilgamesh into the
episode is revealed by this awkward and entirely meaningless
repetition. We may therefore reconstruct the first two scenes in the
Enkidu Epic as follows:<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1782src" href=
"#xd26e1782" name="xd26e1782src">106</a></p>
<p>Tablet I, col. 2, 34&ndash;35: Creation of Enkidu by Aruru.</p>
<p>36&ndash;41: Description of Enkidu&rsquo;s hairy body and of his
life with the animals.</p>
<p>42&ndash;50: The hunter sees Enkidu, who shows his anger, as also
his woe, at his condition.</p>
<p>3, 1&ndash;12: The hunter tells his father of the strange being who
pulls up the traps which the hunter digs, and who tears the nets so
that the hunter is unable to catch him or the animals.</p>
<p>19&ndash;24: The father of the hunter advises his son on his next
expedition to take a woman with him in order to lure the strange being
from his life with the animals.</p>
<p>Line 25, beginning &ldquo;On the advice of his father,&rdquo; must
have set forth, in the original form of the episode, how the hunter
procured the woman and took her with him to meet Enkidu.</p>
<p>Column 4 gives in detail the meeting between the two, and
na&iuml;vely describes how the woman exposes her charms to Enkidu, who
is captivated by her and stays with her six days and seven nights. The
animals see the change in Enkidu and run away from him. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="p43" href="#p43" name="p43">43</a>]</span>He has been
transformed through the woman. So far the episode. In the Assyrian
version there follows an address of the woman to Enkidu beginning (col.
4, 34):</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Beautiful art thou, Enkidu, like a god art
thou.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">We find her urging him to go with her to Erech, there
to meet Gilgamesh and to enjoy the pleasures of city life with plenty
of beautiful maidens. Gilgamesh, she adds, will expect Enkidu, for the
coming of the latter to Erech has been foretold in a dream. It is
evident that here we have again the later transformation of the Enkidu
Epic in order to bring the two heroes together. Will it be considered
too bold if we assume that in the original form the address of the
woman and the construction of the episode were such as we find
preserved in part in columns 2 to 4 of the Pennsylvania tablet, which
forms part of the new material that can now be added to the Epic? The
address of the woman begins in line 51 of the Pennsylvania tablet:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;I gaze upon thee, Enkidu, like a god art
thou.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">This corresponds to the line in the Assyrian version
(I, 4, 34) as given above, just as lines 52&ndash;53:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Why with the cattle</p>
<p class="line">Dost thou roam across the field?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">correspond to I, 4, 35, of the Assyrian version. There
follows in both the old Babylonian and the Assyrian version the appeal
of the woman to Enkidu, to allow her to lead him to Erech where
Gilgamesh dwells (Pennsylvania tablet lines 54&ndash;61 = Assyrian
version I, 4, 36&ndash;39); but in the Pennsylvania tablet we now have
a <i>second</i> speech (lines 62&ndash;63) beginning like the first one
with <i lang="obab">al-ka</i>, &ldquo;come:&rdquo;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Come, arise from the accursed ground.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Enkidu consents, and now the woman takes off her
garments and clothes the naked Enkidu, while putting another garment on
herself. She takes hold of his hand and leads him to the sheepfolds
(not to Erech!!), where bread and wine are placed before him.
Accustomed hitherto to sucking milk with cattle, Enkidu does not know
what to do with the strange food until encouraged and instructed by the
woman. The entire third column is taken up with this introduction
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="p44" href="#p44" name=
"p44">44</a>]</span>of Enkidu to civilized life in a pastoral
community, and the scene ends with Enkidu becoming a guardian of
flocks. Now all this has nothing to do with Gilgamesh, and clearly sets
forth an entirely different idea from the one embodied in the meeting
of the two heroes. In the original Enkidu tale, the animal-man is
looked upon as the type of a primitive savage, and the point of the
tale is to illustrate in the na&iuml;ve manner characteristic of
folklore the evolution to the higher form of pastoral life. This aspect
of the incident is, therefore, to be separated from the other phase
which has as its chief <i>motif</i> the bringing of the two heroes
together.</p>
<p>We now obtain, thanks to the new section revealed by the
Pennsylvania tablet, a further analogy<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1837src" href="#xd26e1837" name="xd26e1837src">107</a> with the
story of Adam and Eve, but with this striking difference, that whereas
in the Babylonian tale the woman is the medium leading man to the
higher life, in the Biblical story the woman is the tempter who brings
misfortune to man. This contrast is, however, not inherent in the
Biblical story, but due to the point of view of the Biblical writer,
who is somewhat pessimistically inclined and looks upon primitive life,
when man went naked and lived in a garden, eating of fruits that grew
of themselves, as the blessed life in contrast to advanced culture
which leads to agriculture and necessitates hard work as the means of
securing one&rsquo;s substance. Hence the woman through whom Adam eats
of the tree of knowledge and becomes conscious of being naked is looked
upon as an evil tempter, entailing the loss of the primeval life of
bliss in a gorgeous Paradise. The Babylonian point of view is
optimistic. The change to civilized life&mdash;involving the wearing of
clothes and the eating of food that is cultivated (bread and wine) is
looked upon as an advance. Hence the woman is viewed as the medium of
raising man to a higher level. The feature common to the Biblical and
Babylonian tales is the attachment of a lesson to early folk-tales. The
story of Adam and Eve,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1843src" href=
"#xd26e1843" name="xd26e1843src">108</a> as the story of Enkidu and the
woman, is told <i>with a purpose</i>. Starting with early traditions of
men&rsquo;s primitive life on earth, that may have arisen
independently, Hebrew and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="p45" href=
"#p45" name="p45">45</a>]</span>Babylonian writers diverged, each group
going its own way, each reflecting the particular point of view from
which the evolution of human society was viewed.</p>
<p>Leaving the analogy between the Biblical and Babylonian tales aside,
the main point of value for us in the Babylonian story of Enkidu and
the woman is the proof furnished by the analysis, made possible through
the Pennsylvania tablet, that the tale can be separated from its
subsequent connection with Gilgamesh. We can continue this process of
separation in the fourth column, where the woman instructs Enkidu in
the further duty of living his life with the woman decreed for him, to
raise a family, to engage in work, to build cities and to gather
resources. All this is looked upon in the same optimistic spirit as
marking progress, whereas the Biblical writer, consistent with his
point of view, looks upon work as a curse, and makes Cain, the
murderer, also the founder of cities. The step to the higher forms of
life is not an advance according to the J document. It is interesting
to note that even the phrase the &ldquo;cursed ground&rdquo; occurs in
both the Babylonian and Biblical tales; but whereas in the latter (Gen.
3, 17) it is because of the hard work entailed in raising the products
of the earth that the ground is cursed, in the former (lines
62&ndash;63) it is the place in which Enkidu lives <i>before</i> he
advances to the dignity of human life that is &ldquo;cursed,&rdquo; and
which he is asked to leave. Adam is expelled from Paradise as a
punishment, whereas Enkidu is implored to leave it as a necessary step
towards <i>progress</i> to a higher form of existence. The contrast
between the Babylonian and the Biblical writer extends to the view
taken of viniculture. The Biblical writer (again the J document) looks
upon Noah&rsquo;s drunkenness as a disgrace. Noah loses his sense of
shame and uncovers himself (<a class="biblink xd26e190" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen%209:21&amp;version=NRSV">Genesis
9, 21</a>), whereas in the Babylonian description Enkidu&rsquo;s jolly
spirit after he has drunk seven jars of wine meets with approval. The
Biblical point of view is that he who drinks wine becomes
drunk;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1871src" href="#xd26e1871" name=
"xd26e1871src">109</a> the Babylonian says, if you drink wine you
become happy.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1877src" href="#xd26e1877"
name="xd26e1877src">110</a></p>
<p>If the thesis here set forth of the original character and import of
the episode of Enkidu with the woman is correct, we may again regard
lines 149&ndash;153 of the Pennsylvania tablet, in which Gilgamesh is
introduced, as a later addition to bring the two heroes into
association. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="p46" href="#p46" name=
"p46">46</a>]</span>The episode in its original form ended with the
introduction of Enkidu first to pastoral life, and then to the still
higher city life with regulated forms of social existence.</p>
<p>Now, to be sure, this Enkidu has little in common with the Enkidu
who is described as a powerful warrior, a Hercules, who kills lions,
overcomes the giant &#7722;uwawa, and dispatches a great bull, but it
is the nature of folklore everywhere to attach to traditions about a
favorite hero all kinds of tales with which originally he had nothing
to do. Enkidu, as such a favorite, is viewed also as the type of
primitive man,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1886src" href="#xd26e1886"
name="xd26e1886src">111</a> and so there arose gradually an Epic which
began with his birth, pictured him as half-animal half-man, told how he
emerged from this state, how he became civilized, was clothed, learned
to eat food and drink wine, how he shaved off the hair with which his
body was covered,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1889src" href="#xd26e1889"
name="xd26e1889src">112</a> anointed himself&mdash;in short,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;He became manlike.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1895src" href="#xd26e1895" name="xd26e1895src">113</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">Thereupon he is taught his duties as a husband, is
introduced to the work of building, and to laying aside supplies, and
the like. The fully-developed and full-fledged hero then engages in
various exploits, of which <i>some</i> are now embodied in the
Gilgamesh Epic. Who this Enkidu was, we are not in a position to
determine, but the suggestion has been thrown out above that he is a
personage foreign to Babylonia, that his home appears to be in the
undefined Amurru district, and that he conquers that district. The
original tale of Enkidu, if this view be correct, must therefore have
been carried to the Euphrates Valley, at a very remote period, with one
of the migratory waves that brought a western people as invaders into
Babylonia. Here the tale was combined with stories current of another
hero, Gilgamesh&mdash;perhaps also of Western origin&mdash;whose
conquest of Erech likewise represents an invasion of Babylonia. The
center of the Gilgamesh tale was Erech, and in the process of combining
the stories of Enkidu and Gilgamesh, Enkidu is brought to Erech and the
two perform exploits <span class="pagenum">[<a id="p47" href="#p47"
name="p47">47</a>]</span>in common. In such a combination, the aim
would be to utilize all the incidents of <i>both</i> tales. The woman
who accompanies Enkidu, therefore, becomes the medium of bringing the
two heroes together. The story of the evolution of primitive man to
civilized life is transformed into the tale of Enkidu&rsquo;s removal
to Erech, and elaborated with all kinds of details, among which we
have, as perhaps embodying a genuine historical tradition, the
encounter of the two heroes.</p>
<p>Before passing on, we have merely to note the very large part taken
in both the old Babylonian and the Assyrian version by the struggle
against &#7722;uwawa. The entire Yale tablet&mdash;forming, as we have
seen, the third of the series&mdash;is taken up with the preparation
for the struggle, and with the repeated warnings given to Gilgamesh
against the dangerous undertaking. The fourth tablet must have
recounted the struggle itself, and it is not improbable that this
episode extended into the fifth tablet, since in the Assyrian version
this is the case. The elaboration of the story is in itself an argument
in favor of assuming some historical background for it&mdash;the
recollection of the conquest of Amurru by some powerful warrior; and we
have seen that this conquest must be ascribed to Enkidu and not to
Gilgamesh.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">If, now, Enkidu is not only the older figure but the
one who is the real hero of the most notable episode in the Gilgamesh
Epic; if, furthermore, Enkidu is the Hercules who kills lions and
dispatches the bull sent by an enraged goddess, what becomes of
Gilgamesh? What is left for him?</p>
<p>In the first place, he is definitely the conqueror of Erech. He
builds the wall of Erech,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1917src" href=
"#xd26e1917" name="xd26e1917src">114</a> and we may assume that the
designation of the city as <i>Uruk sup&ucirc;ri</i>, &ldquo;the walled
Erech,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1932src" href="#xd26e1932"
name="xd26e1932src">115</a> rests upon this tradition. He is also
associated with the great temple Eanna, &ldquo;the heavenly
house,&rdquo; in Erech. To Gilgamesh belongs also the unenviable
tradition of having exercised his rule in Erech so harshly that the
people are impelled to implore Aruru to create a rival who may rid
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="p48" href="#p48" name=
"p48">48</a>]</span>the district of the cruel tyrant, who is described
as snatching sons and daughters from their families, and in other ways
terrifying the population&mdash;an early example of &ldquo;<span lang=
"de">Schrecklichkeit</span>.&rdquo; Tablets II to V inclusive of the
Assyrian version being taken up with the &#7722;uwawa episode, modified
with a view of bringing the two heroes together, we come at once to the
sixth tablet, which tells the story of how the goddess Ishtar wooed
Gilgamesh, and of the latter&rsquo;s rejection of her advances. This
tale is distinctly a nature myth. The attempt of Gressmann<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1944src" href="#xd26e1944" name=
"xd26e1944src">116</a> to find some historical background to the
episode is a failure. The goddess Ishtar symbolizes the earth which
woos the sun in the spring, but whose love is fatal, for after a few
months the sun&rsquo;s power begins to wane. Gilgamesh, who in
incantation hymns is invoked in terms which show that he was conceived
as a sun-god,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1954src" href="#xd26e1954"
name="xd26e1954src">117</a> recalls to the goddess how she changed her
lovers into animals, like Circe of Greek mythology, and brought them to
grief. Enraged at Gilgamesh&rsquo;s insult to her vanity, she flies to
her father Anu and cries for revenge. At this point the episode of the
creation of the bull is introduced, but if the analysis above given is
correct it is Enkidu who is the hero in dispatching the bull, and we
must assume that the sickness with which Gilgamesh is smitten is the
punishment sent by Anu to avenge the insult to his daughter. This
sickness symbolizes the waning strength of the sun after midsummer is
past. The sun recedes from the earth, and this was pictured in the myth
as the sun-god&rsquo;s rejection of Ishtar; Gilgamesh&rsquo;s fear of
death marks the approach of the winter season, when the sun appears to
have lost its vigor completely and is near to death. The entire episode
is, therefore, a nature myth, symbolical of the passing of spring to
midsummer and then to the bare season. The myth has been attached to
Gilgamesh as a favorite figure, and then woven into a pattern with the
episode of Enkidu and the bull. The bull episode can be detached from
the nature myth without any loss to the symbolism of the tale of Ishtar
and Gilgamesh.</p>
<p>As already suggested, with Enkidu&rsquo;s death after this conquest
of the bull the original Enkidu Epic came to an end. In order to
connect Gilgamesh with Enkidu, the former is represented as sharing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="p49" href="#p49" name=
"p49">49</a>]</span>in the struggle against the bull. Enkidu is
punished with death, while Gilgamesh is smitten with disease. Since
both shared equally in the guilt, the punishment should have been the
same for both. The differentiation may be taken as an indication that
Gilgamesh&rsquo;s disease has nothing to do with the bull episode, but
is merely part of the nature myth.</p>
<p>Gilgamesh now begins a series of wanderings in search of the
restoration of his vigor, and this <i>motif</i> is evidently a
continuation of the nature myth to symbolize the sun&rsquo;s wanderings
during the dark winter in the hope of renewed vigor with the coming of
the spring. Professor Haupt&rsquo;s view is that the disease from which
Gilgamesh is supposed to be suffering is of a venereal character,
affecting the organs of reproduction. This would confirm the position
here taken that the myth symbolizes the loss of the sun&rsquo;s vigor.
The sun&rsquo;s rays are no longer strong enough to fertilize the
earth. In accord with this, Gilgamesh&rsquo;s search for healing leads
him to the dark regions<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1966src" href=
"#xd26e1966" name="xd26e1966src">118</a> in which the scorpion-men
dwell. The terrors of the region symbolize the gloom of the winter
season. At last Gilgamesh reaches a region of light again, described as
a landscape situated at the sea. The maiden in control of this region
bolts the gate against Gilgamesh&rsquo;s approach, but the latter
forces his entrance. It is the picture of the sun-god bursting through
the darkness, to emerge as the youthful reinvigorated sun-god of the
spring.</p>
<p>Now with the tendency to attach to popular tales and nature myths
lessons illustrative of current beliefs and aspirations,
Gilgamesh&rsquo;s search for renewal of life is viewed as man&rsquo;s
longing for eternal life. The sun-god&rsquo;s waning power after
midsummer is past suggests man&rsquo;s growing weakness after the
meridian of life has been left behind. Winter is death, and man longs
to escape it. Gilgamesh&rsquo;s wanderings are used as illustration of
this longing, and accordingly the search for life becomes also the
quest for immortality. Can the precious boon of eternal life be
achieved? Popular fancy created the figure of a favorite of the gods
who had escaped a destructive deluge in which all mankind had
perished.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1971src" href="#xd26e1971" name=
"xd26e1971src">119</a> Gilgamesh hears <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"p50" href="#p50" name="p50">50</a>]</span>of this favorite and
determines to seek him out and learn from him the secret of eternal
life. The deluge story, again a pure nature myth, symbolical of the
rainy season which destroys all life in nature, is thus attached to the
Epic. Gilgamesh after many adventures finds himself in the presence of
the survivor of the Deluge who, although human, enjoys immortal life
among the gods. He asks the survivor how he came to escape the common
fate of mankind, and in reply Utnapishtim tells the story of the
catastrophe that brought about universal destruction. The moral of the
tale is obvious. Only those singled out by the special favor of the
gods can hope to be removed to the distant &ldquo;source of the
streams&rdquo; and live forever. The rest of mankind must face death as
the end of life.</p>
<p>That the story of the Deluge is told in the eleventh tablet of the
series, corresponding to the eleventh month, known as the month of
&ldquo;rain curse&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1989src" href=
"#xd26e1989" name="xd26e1989src">120</a> and marking the height of the
rainy season, may be intentional, just as it may not be accidental that
Gilgamesh&rsquo;s rejection of Ishtar is recounted in the sixth tablet,
corresponding to the sixth month,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1992src"
href="#xd26e1992" name="xd26e1992src">121</a> which marks the end of
the summer season. The two tales may have formed part of a cycle of
myths, distributed among the months of the year. The Gilgamesh Epic,
however, does not form such a cycle. Both myths have been artificially
attached to the adventures of the hero. For the deluge story we now
have the definite proof for its independent existence, through Dr.
Poebel&rsquo;s publication of a Sumerian text which embodies the
tale,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1995src" href="#xd26e1995" name=
"xd26e1995src">122</a> and without any reference <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="p51" href="#p51" name="p51">51</a>]</span>to
Gilgamesh. Similarly, Scheil and Hilprecht have published fragments of
deluge stories written in Akkadian and likewise without any connection
with the Gilgamesh Epic.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2019src" href=
"#xd26e2019" name="xd26e2019src">123</a></p>
<p>In the Epic the story leads to another episode attached to
Gilgamesh, namely, the search for a magic plant growing in deep water,
which has the power of restoring old age to youth. Utnapishtim, the
survivor of the deluge, is moved through pity for Gilgamesh, worn out
by his long wanderings. At the request of his wife, Utnapishtim decides
to tell Gilgamesh of this plant, and he succeeds in finding it. He
plucks it and decides to take it back to Erech so that all may enjoy
the benefit, but on his way stops to bathe in a cool cistern. A serpent
comes along and snatches the plant from him, and he is forced to return
to Erech with his purpose unachieved. Man cannot hope, when old age
comes on, to escape death as the end of everything.</p>
<p>Lastly, the twelfth tablet of the Assyrian version of the Gilgamesh
Epic is of a purely didactic character, bearing evidence of having been
added as a further illustration of the current belief that there is no
escape from the nether world to which all must go after life has come
to an end. Proper burial and suitable care of the dead represent all
that can be done in order to secure a fairly comfortable rest for those
who have passed out of this world. Enkidu is once more introduced into
this episode. His shade is invoked by Gilgamesh and rises up out of the
lower world to give a discouraging reply to Gilgamesh&rsquo;s
request,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Tell me, my friend, tell me, my friend,</p>
<p class="line">The law of the earth which thou hast</p>
<p class="line">experienced, tell me,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The mournful message comes back:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;I cannot tell thee, my friend, I cannot
tell.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Death is a mystery and must always remain such. The
historical Gilgamesh has clearly no connection with the figure
introduced into <span class="pagenum">[<a id="p52" href="#p52" name=
"p52">52</a>]</span>this twelfth tablet. Indeed, as already suggested,
the Gilgamesh Epic must have ended with the return to Erech, as related
at the close of the eleventh tablet. The twelfth tablet was added by
some school-men of Babylonia (or perhaps of Assyria), purely for the
purpose of conveying a summary of the teachings in regard to the fate
of the dead. Whether these six episodes covering the sixth to the
twelfth tablets, (1) the nature myth, (2) the killing of the divine
bull, (3) the punishment of Gilgamesh and the death of Enkidu, (4)
Gilgamesh&rsquo;s wanderings, (5) the Deluge, (6) the search for
immortality, were all included at the time that the old Babylonian
version was compiled cannot, of course, be determined until we have
that version in a more complete form. Since the two tablets thus far
recovered show that as early as 2000 B.C. the Enkidu tale had already
been amalgamated with the current stories about Gilgamesh, and the
endeavor made to transfer the traits of the former to the latter, it is
eminently likely that the story of Ishtar&rsquo;s unhappy love
adventure with Gilgamesh was included, as well as Gilgamesh&rsquo;s
punishment and the death of Enkidu. With the evidence furnished by
Meissner&rsquo;s fragment of a version of the old Babylonian revision
and by our two tablets, of the early disposition to make popular tales
the medium of illustrating current beliefs and the teachings of the
temple schools, it may furthermore be concluded that the death of
Enkidu and the punishment of Gilgamesh were utilized for didactic
purposes in the old Babylonian version. On the other hand, the proof
for the existence of the deluge story in the Hammurabi period and some
centuries later, <i>independent</i> of any connection with the
Gilgamesh Epic, raises the question whether in the old Babylonian
version, of which our two tablets form a part, the deluge tale was
already woven into the pattern of the Epic. At all events, till proof
to the contrary is forthcoming, we may assume that the twelfth tablet
of the Assyrian version, though also reverting to a Babylonian
original, dates as the <i>latest</i> addition to the Epic from a period
subsequent to 2000 B.C.; and that the same is probably the case with
the eleventh tablet.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="label">IX.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">To sum up, there are four main currents that flow
together in the Gilgamesh Epic even in its old Babylonian form: (1) the
adventures of a mighty warrior Enkidu, resting perhaps on a faint
tradition <span class="pagenum">[<a id="p53" href="#p53" name=
"p53">53</a>]</span>of the conquest of Amurru by the hero; (2) the more
definite recollection of the exploits of a foreign invader of Babylonia
by the name of Gilgamesh, whose home appears likewise to have been in
the West;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2065src" href="#xd26e2065" name=
"xd26e2065src">124</a> (3) nature myths and didactic tales transferred
to Enkidu and Gilgamesh as popular figures; and (4) the process of
weaving the traditions, exploits, myths and didactic tales together, in
the course of which process Gilgamesh becomes the main hero, and Enkidu
his companion.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our investigation has shown that to Enkidu belongs the
episode with the woman, used to illustrate the evolution of primitive
man to the ways and conditions of civilized life, the conquest of
&#7722;uwawa in the land of Amurru, the killing of lions and also of
the bull, while Gilgamesh is the hero who conquers Erech. Identified
with the sun-god, the nature myth of the union of the sun with the
earth and the subsequent separation of the two is also transferred to
him. The wanderings of the hero, smitten with disease, are a
continuation of the nature myth, symbolizing the waning vigor of the
sun with the approach of the wintry season.</p>
<p>The details of the process which led to making Gilgamesh the
favorite figure, to whom the traits and exploits of Enkidu and of the
sun-god are transferred, escape us, but of the fact that Enkidu is the
<i>older</i> figure, of whom certain adventures were set forth in a
tale that once had an independent existence, there can now be little
doubt in the face of the evidence furnished by the two tablets of the
old Babylonian version; just as the study of these tablets shows that
in the combination of the tales of Enkidu and Gilgamesh, the former is
the prototype of which Gilgamesh is the copy. If the two are regarded
as brothers, as born in the same place, even resembling one another in
appearance and carrying out their adventures in common, it is because
in the process of combination Gilgamesh becomes the <i>reflex</i> of
Enkidu. That Enkidu is not the figure created by Aruru to relieve Erech
of its tyrannical ruler is also shown by the fact that Gilgamesh
remains in control of Erech. It is to Erech that he returns when he
fails of his purpose to learn the secret of escape from old age and
death. Erech is, therefore, not relieved of the presence of the
ruthless ruler through Enkidu. The &ldquo;Man of Anu&rdquo; formed by
Aruru as a deliverer is confused in the course of the growth of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="p54" href="#p54" name=
"p54">54</a>]</span>Epic with Enkidu, the offspring of Ninib, and in
this way we obtain the strange contradiction of Enkidu and Gilgamesh
appearing first as bitter rivals and then as close and inseparable
friends. It is of the nature of Epic compositions everywhere to
eliminate unnecessary figures by concentrating on one favorite the
traits belonging to another or to several others.</p>
<p>The close association of Enkidu and Gilgamesh which becomes one of
the striking features in the combination of the tales of these two
heroes naturally recalls the &ldquo;Heavenly Twins&rdquo; <i>motif</i>,
which has been so fully and so suggestively treated by Professor J.
Rendell Harris in his <i>Cult of the Heavenly Twins</i>, (London,
1906). Professor Harris has conclusively shown how widespread the
tendency is to associate two divine or semi-divine beings in myths and
legends as inseparable companions<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2088src"
href="#xd26e2088" name="xd26e2088src">125</a> or twins, like Castor and
Pollux, Romulus and Remus,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2111src" href=

mythology, Patollo and Potrimpo in old Prussian mythology, Cautes and
Cautopates in Mithraism, Jesus and Thomas (according to the Syriac Acts
of Thomas), and the various illustrations of &ldquo;Dioscuri in
Christian Legends,&rdquo; set forth by Dr. Harris in his work under
this title, which carries the <i>motif</i> far down into the period of
legends about Christian Saints who appear in pairs, including the
reference to such a pair in Shakespeare&rsquo;s Henry V:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;And Crispin Crispian shall ne&rsquo;er go by</p>
<p class="line">From that day to the ending of the
world.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Act, IV, 3, 57&ndash;58.</i>)</p>
</div>
<p class="first">There are indeed certain parallels which suggest that
Enkidu-Gilgamesh may represent a Babylonian counterpart to the
&ldquo;Heavenly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="p55" href="#p55" name=
"p55">55</a>]</span>Twins.&rdquo; In the Indo-Iranian, Greek and Roman
mythology, the twins almost invariably act together. In unison they
proceed on expeditions to punish enemies.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2150src" href="#xd26e2150" name="xd26e2150src">129</a></p>
<p>But after all, the parallels are of too general a character to be of
much moment; and moreover the parallels stop short at the critical
point, for Gilgamesh though worsted is <i>not</i> killed by Enkidu,
whereas one of the &ldquo;Heavenly Twins&rdquo; is always killed by the
brother, as Abel is by Cain, and Iphikles by his twin brother Herakles.
Even the trait which is frequent in the earliest forms of the
&ldquo;Heavenly Twins,&rdquo; according to which one is immortal and
the other is mortal, though applying in a measure to Enkidu who is
killed by Ishtar, while Gilgamesh the offspring of a divine pair is
only smitten with disease, is too unsubstantial to warrant more than a
general comparison between the Enkidu-Gilgamesh pair and the various
forms of the &ldquo;twin&rdquo; <i>motif</i> found throughout the
ancient world. For all that, the point is of some interest that in the
Gilgamesh Epic we should encounter two figures who are portrayed as
possessing the same traits and accomplishing feats in common, which
suggest a partial parallel to the various forms in which the
twin-<i>motif</i> appears in the mythologies, folk-lore and legends of
many nations; and it may be that in some of these instances the
duplication is due, as in the case of Enkidu and Gilgamesh, to an
actual transfer of the traits of one figure to another who usurped his
place.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In concluding this study of the two recently
discovered tablets of the old Babylonian version of the Gilgamesh Epic
which has brought us several steps further in the interpretation and in
our understanding of the method of composition of the most notable
literary production of ancient Babylonia, it will be proper to consider
the <i>literary</i> relationship of the old Babylonian to the Assyrian
version.</p>
<p>We have already referred to the different form in which the names of
the chief figures appear in the old Babylonian version,
<sup>d</sup>Gish as against <sup>d</sup>Gish-g&igrave;(n)-mash,
<sup>d</sup>En-ki-d&#361; as against <sup>d</sup>En-ki-d&uacute;,
&#7722;u-wa-wa as against &#7722;u(m)-ba-ba. Erech appears as <i lang=
"obab">Uruk rib&icirc;tim</i>, &ldquo;Erech of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="p56" href="#p56" name="p56">56</a>]</span>the
Plazas,&rdquo; as against <i lang="obab">Uruk sup&ucirc;ri</i>,
&ldquo;walled Erech&rdquo; (or &ldquo;Erech within the walls&rdquo;),
in the Assyrian version.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2198src" href=
"#xd26e2198" name="xd26e2198src">130</a> These variations point to an
<i>independent</i> recension for the Assyrian revision; and this
conclusion is confirmed by a comparison of parallel passages in our two
tablets with the Assyrian version, for such parallels rarely extend to
verbal agreements in details, and, moreover, show that the Assyrian
version has been elaborated.</p>
<p>Beginning with the Pennsylvania tablet, column I is covered in the
Assyrian version by tablet I, 5, 25, to 6, 33, though, as pointed out
above, in the Assyrian version we have the anticipation of the dreams
of Gilgamesh and their interpretation through their recital to Enkidu
by his female companion, whereas in the old Babylonian version we have
the dreams <i>directly</i> given in a conversation between Gilgamesh
and his mother. In the anticipation, there would naturally be some
omissions. So lines 4&ndash;5 and 12&ndash;13 of the Pennsylvania
tablet do not appear in the Assyrian version, but in their place is a
line (I, 5, 35), to be restored to</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;[I saw him and like] a woman I fell in love with
him.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">which occurs in the old Babylonian version only in
connection with the second dream. The point is of importance as showing
that in the Babylonian version the first dream lays stress upon the
omen of the falling meteor, as symbolizing the coming of Enkidu,
whereas the second dream more specifically reveals Enkidu as a
man,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2217src" href="#xd26e2217" name=
"xd26e2217src">131</a> of whom Gilgamesh is instantly enamored.
Strikingly variant lines, though conveying the same idea, are frequent.
Thus line 14 of the Babylonian version reads</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;I bore it and carried it to thee&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">and appears in the Assyrian version (I, 5,
35<i><sup>b</sup></i> supplied from 6, 26)</p>
<div class="lgouter">

</div>
<p class="first">The important lines 31&ndash;36 are not found in the
Assyrian version, with the exception of I, 6, 27, which corresponds to
lines 33&ndash;34, but this lack of correspondence is probably due to
the fact that the Assyrian version represents the anticipation of the
dreams which, as already suggested, might well omit some details. As
against this we have in the Assyrian version I, 6, 23&ndash;25, an
elaboration of line 30 in the Pennsylvania tablet and taken over from
the recital of the first dream. Through the Assyrian version I, 6,
31&ndash;32, we can restore the closing lines of column I of the
Pennsylvania tablet, while with line 33 = line 45 of the Pennsylvania
tablet, the parallel between the two versions comes to an end. Lines
34&ndash;43 of the Assyrian version (bringing tablet I to a
close)<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2304src" href="#xd26e2304" name=
"xd26e2304src">135</a> represent an elaboration of the speech of

of this sort appears to have been included in the old Babylonian
version.<span class="pagenum">[<a id="p58" href="#p58" name=
"p58">58</a>]</span>Our text proceeds with the scene between Enkidu and
the woman, in which the latter by her charms and her appeal endeavors
to lead Enkidu away from his life with the animals. From the abrupt
manner in which the scene is introduced in line 43 of the Pennsylvania
tablet, it is evident that this cannot be the <i>first</i> mention of
the woman. The meeting must have been recounted in the first tablet, as
is the case in the Assyrian version.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2321src" href="#xd26e2321" name="xd26e2321src">137</a> The second
tablet takes up the direct recital of the dreams of Gilgamesh and then
continues the narrative. Whether in the old Babylonian version the
scene between Enkidu and the woman was described with the same
na&iuml;ve details, as in the Assyrian version, of the sexual
intercourse between the two for six days and seven nights cannot of
course be determined, though presumably the Assyrian version, with the
tendency of epics to become more elaborate as they pass from age to
age, added some realistic touches. Assuming that lines 44&ndash;63 of
the Pennsylvania tablet&mdash;the cohabitation of Enkidu and the
address of the woman&mdash;is a repetition of what was already
described in the first tablet, the comparison with the Assyrian version
I, 4, 16&ndash;41, not only points to the elaboration of the later
version, but likewise to an independent recension, even where parallel
lines can be picked out. Only lines 46&ndash;48 of the Pennsylvania
tablet form a complete parallel to line 21 of column 4 of the Assyrian
version. The description in lines 22&ndash;32 of column 4 is missing,
though it may, of course, have been included in part in the recital in
the first tablet of the old Babylonian version. Lines 49&ndash;59 of
the Pennsylvania tablet are covered by 33&ndash;39, the only slight
difference being the specific mention in line 58 of the Pennsylvania
tablet of Eanna, the temple in Erech, described as &ldquo;the dwelling
of Anu,&rdquo; whereas in the Assyrian version Eanna is merely referred
to as the &ldquo;holy house&rdquo; and described as &ldquo;the dwelling
of Anu and Ishtar,&rdquo; where Ishtar is clearly a later addition.</p>
<p>Leaving aside lines 60&ndash;61, which may be merely a variant
(though independent) of line 39 of column 4 of the Assyrian version, we
now have in the Pennsylvania tablet a second speech of the woman to
Enkidu (not represented in the Assyrian version) beginning like the
first one with <i lang="obab">alka</i>, &ldquo;Come&rdquo; (lines
62&ndash;63), in which she asks Enkidu to leave the &ldquo;accursed
ground&rdquo; in which he dwells. This speech, as the description which
follows, extending into columns 3&ndash;4, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="p59" href="#p59" name="p59">59</a>]</span>and telling
how the woman clothed Enkidu, how she brought him to the sheep folds,
how she taught him to eat bread and to drink wine, and how she
instructed him in the ways of civilization, must have been included in
the second tablet of the Assyrian version which has come down to us in
a very imperfect form. Nor is the scene in which Enkidu and Gilgamesh
have their encounter found in the preserved portions of the second (or
possibly the third) tablet of the Assyrian version, but only a brief
reference to it in the fourth tablet,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2334src" href="#xd26e2334" name="xd26e2334src">138</a> in which
in Epic style the story is repeated, leading up to the second
exploit&mdash;the joint campaign of Enkidu and Gilgamesh against
&#7722;uwawa. This reference, covering only seven lines, corresponds to
lines 192&ndash;231 of the Pennsylvania tablet; but the former being
the repetition and the latter the original recital, the comparison to
be instituted merely reveals again the independence of the Assyrian
version, as shown in the use of <i lang="obab">kibsu</i>,
&ldquo;tread&rdquo; (IV, 2, 46), for <i lang=
"obab">&scaron;&ecirc;pu</i>, &ldquo;foot&rdquo; (l. 216), <i lang=
"obab">i-na-u&scaron;</i>, &ldquo;quake&rdquo; (line 5C), as against
<i lang="obab">ir-tu-tu</i> (ll. 221 and 226).</p>

</div>
<p class="first">all point once more to the literary independence of
the Assyrian version. The end of the conflict and the reconciliation of
the two heroes is likewise missing in the Assyrian version. It may have
been referred to at the beginning of column 3<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2388src" href="#xd26e2388" name="xd26e2388src">139</a> of Tablet
IV.</p>
<p>Coming to the Yale tablet, the few passages in which a comparison
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="p60" href="#p60" name=
"p60">60</a>]</span>may be instituted with the fourth tablet of the
Assyrian version, to which in a general way it must correspond, are not
sufficient to warrant any conclusions, beyond the confirmation of the
literary independence of the Assyrian version. The section comprised
within lines 72&ndash;89, where Enkidu&rsquo;s grief at his
friend&rsquo;s decision to fight &#7722;uwawa is described<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2395src" href="#xd26e2395" name=
"xd26e2395src">140</a>, and he makes confession of his own physical
exhaustion, <i>may</i> correspond to Tablet IV, column 4, of the
Assyrian version. This would fit in with the beginning of the reverse,
the first two lines of which (136&ndash;137) correspond to column 5 of
the fourth tablet of the Assyrian version, with a variation
&ldquo;seven-fold fear&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2401src" href=
"#xd26e2401" name="xd26e2401src">141</a> as against &ldquo;fear of
men&rdquo; in the Assyrian version. If lines 138&ndash;139 (in column
4) of the Yale tablet correspond to line 7 of column 5 of Tablet IV of
the Assyrian version, we would again have an illustration of the
elaboration of the later version by the addition of lines 3&ndash;6.
But beyond this we have merely the comparison of the description of
&#7722;uwawa</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Whose roar is a flood, whose mouth is fire, and
whose breath is death&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">which occurs twice in the Yale tablet (lines
110&ndash;111 and 196&ndash;197), with the same phrase in the Assyrian
version Tablet IV, 5, 3&mdash;but here, as just pointed out, with an
elaboration.</p>
<p>Practically, therefore, the entire Yale tablet represents an
addition to our knowledge of the &#7722;uwawa episode, and until we are
fortunate enough to discover more fragments of the fourth tablet of the
Assyrian version, we must content ourselves with the conclusions
reached from a comparison of the Pennsylvania tablet with the parallels
in the Assyrian version.</p>
<p>It may be noted as a general point of resemblance in the exterior
form of the old Babylonian and Assyrian versions that both were
inscribed on tablets containing six columns, three on the obverse and
three on the reverse; and that the length of the tablets&mdash;an
average of 40 to 50 lines&mdash;was about the same, thus revealing in
the external form a conventiona1 size for the tablets in the older
period, which was carried over into later times. <span class=

supplemented by Haupt&rsquo;s article <i lang="de">Die Zw&ouml;lfte
Tafel des Babylonischen Nimrodepos</i> in <i>BA</i> I, pp. 48&ndash;79,
containing the fragments of the twelfth tablet. The fragments of the
Epic in Ashurbanapal&rsquo;s library&mdash;some sixty&mdash;represent
portions of several copies. Sin-li&#7731;&icirc;-unnini&mdash;perhaps
from Erech, since this name appears as that of a family in tablets from
Erech (see Clay, <i>Legal Documents from Erech</i>, Index, p.
73)&mdash;is named in a list of texts (K 9717&mdash;Haupt&rsquo;s
edition No. 51, line 18) as the editor of the Epic, though probably he
was not the only compiler. Since the publication of Haupt&rsquo;s
edition, a few fragments were added by him as an appendix to Alfred
Jeremias <i>Izdubar-Nimrod</i> (Leipzig, 1891) Plates II&ndash;IV, and
two more are embodied in Jensen&rsquo;s transliteration of all the
fragments in the <i lang="de">Keilinschriftliche Bibliothek</i> VI; pp.
116&ndash;265, with elaborate notes, pp. 421&ndash;531. Furthermore a
fragment, obtained from supplementary excavations at Kouyunjik, has
been published by L. W. King in his <i>Supplement to the Catalogue of
the Cuneiform Tablets in the Kouyunjik Collection of the British
Cuneiform Tablets in the Kouyunjik Collection of the British Museum</i>
No. 56 and <i>PSBA</i> Vol. 36, pp. 64&ndash;68. Recently a fragment of
the 6th tablet from the excavations at Assur has been published by
Ebeling, <i>Keilschrifttexte aus Assur Religi&ouml;sen Inhalts</i> No.

<p class="footnote cont">The designation &ldquo;Nimrod Epic&rdquo; on
the supposition that the hero of the Babylonian Epic is identical with
Nimrod, the &ldquo;mighty hunter&rdquo; of <a class="biblink xd26e190"

Genesis 10</a>, has now been generally abandoned, in the absence of any
evidence that the Babylonian hero bore a name like <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e251" href="#xd26e251" name=
"xd26e251">10n</a>]</span>Nimrod. For all that, the description of
Nimrod as the &ldquo;mighty hunter&rdquo; and the occurrence of a
&ldquo;hunter&rdquo; in the Babylonian Epic (Assyrian version Tablet
I)&mdash;though he is not the hero&mdash;points to a confusion in the
Hebrew form of the borrowed tradition between Gilgamesh and Nimrod. The
latest French translation of the Epic is by Dhorme, <i>Choix de Textes
Religieux Assyro-Babyloniens</i> (Paris, 1907), pp. 182&ndash;325; the
latest German translation by Ungnad-Gressmann, <i lang="de">Das
Gilgamesch-Epos</i> (G&ouml;ttingen, 1911), with a valuable analysis
and discussion. These two translations now supersede Jensen&rsquo;s
translation in the <i lang="de">Keilinschriftliche Bibliothek</i>,
which, however, is still valuable because of the detailed notes,
containing a wealth of lexicographical material. Ungnad also gave a
partial translation in Gressmann-Ranke, <i lang="de">Altorientalische
Texte and Bilder</i> I, pp. 39&ndash;61. In English, we have
translations of substantial portions by Muss-Arnolt in Harper&rsquo;s

Similarly, in a second version of the Deluge story, also found in

Professor Clay strongly favors an Amoritic origin also for Gilgamesh.
His explanation of the name is set forth in his recent work on <i>The
Empire of the Amorites</i>, page 89, and is also referred to in his
work on <i>Amurru</i>, page 79, and in his volume of <i>Miscellaneous
Inscriptions in the Yale Babylonian Collection</i>, page 3, note.
According to Professor Clay the original form of the hero&rsquo;s name
was West Semitic, and was something like <i lang="obab">Bilga-Mash</i>,
the meaning of which was perhaps &ldquo;the offspring of Mash.&rdquo;
For the first element in this division of the name cf. Pili&#7731;am,
the name of a ruler of an early dynasty, and Bala&#7731; of the Old
Testament. In view of the fact that the axe figures so prominently in
the Epic as an instrument wielded by Gilgamesh, Professor Clay
furthermore thinks it reasonable to assume that the name was
interpreted by the Babylonian scribe as &ldquo;the axe of Mash.&rdquo;
In this way he would account for the use of the determinative for
weapons, which is also the sign Gish, in the name. It is certainly
noteworthy that the ideogram Gish-T&uacute;n in the later form of
<i lang="obab">Gish-T&uacute;n-mash</i> = <i lang=
"obab">pa&scaron;u</i>, &ldquo;axe,&rdquo; <i>CT</i> XVI, 38:14b, etc.
<i lang="obab">Tun</i> also = <i lang="obab">pila&#7731;u</i>
&ldquo;axe,&rdquo; <i>CT</i> xii, 10:34b. Names with similar element
(besides Pili&#7731;am) are Bela&#7731;u of the Hammurabi period,
Bila&#7731;&#7731;u of the Cassite period, etc.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">It is only proper to add that Professor
Jastrow assumes the responsibility for the explanation of the form and
etymology of the name Gilgamesh proposed in this volume. The question
is one in regard to which legitimate differences of opinion will
prevail among scholars until through some chance a definite decision,
one way or the other, can be reached.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

Only the canal system, directing the overflow into the fields, changed
the curse into a blessing. In contrast to the Deluge, we have in the
Assyrian creation story the drying up of the primeval waters so that
the earth makes its appearance with the change from the rainy to the
dry season. The world is created in the spring, according to the
Akkadian view which is reflected in the Biblical creation story, as
related in the P. document. See Jastrow, <i>Sumerian and Akkadian Views

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><a href="#p.001">Line 1</a>. The verb
<i>tib&ucirc;</i> with <i>pa&scaron;&acirc;ru</i> expresses the aim of
Gish to secure an interpretation for his dream. This disposes of
Langdon&rsquo;s note 1 on page 211 of his edition, in which he also
erroneously speaks of our text as &ldquo;late.&rdquo;
<i>Pa&scaron;&acirc;ru</i> is not a variant of <i>zak&acirc;ru</i>.
Both verbs occur just as here in the Assyrian version I, 5, 25.</p>
<p><a href="#p.003">Line 3</a>. <i>ina &scaron;&acirc;t
mu&scaron;itia</i>, &ldquo;in this my night,&rdquo; i.e., in the course
of this night of mine. A curious way of putting it, but the expression
occurs also in the Assyrian version, e.g., I, 5, 26 (parallel passage
to ours) and II, 4<sup>a</sup>, 14. In the Yale tablet we find,
similarly, <i>mu-&scaron;i-it-ka</i> (l. 262), &ldquo;thy night,&rdquo;
i.e., &ldquo;at night to thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="#p.005">Line 5</a>. Before Langdon put down the strange
statement of Gish &ldquo;wandering about in the midst of omens&rdquo;
(misreading <i>id-da-tim</i> for <i>it-lu-tim</i>), he might have asked
himself the question, what it could possibly mean. How can one walk
among omens?</p>
<p><a href="#p.006">Line 6</a>. <i>ka-ka-bu &scaron;&aacute;-ma-i</i>
must be taken as a compound term for &ldquo;starry heaven.&rdquo; The
parallel passage in the Assyrian version (Tablet I, 5, 27) has the
ideograph for star, with the plural sign as a variant. Literally,
therefore, &ldquo;The starry heaven (or &ldquo;the stars in
heaven&rdquo;) was there,&rdquo; etc. Langdon&rsquo;s note 2 on page
211 rests on an erroneous reading.</p>
<p><a href="#p.007">Line 7</a>. <i>ki&#7779;ru &scaron;&aacute;
Anim</i>, &ldquo;mass of Anu,&rdquo; appears to be the designation of a
meteor, which might well be described as a &ldquo;mass&rdquo; coming
from Anu, i.e., from the god of heaven who becomes the personification
of the heavens in general. In the Assyrian version (I, 5, 28) we have
<i>kima ki-i&#7779;-r&ugrave;</i>, i.e., &ldquo;something like a mass
of heaven.&rdquo; Note also I, 3, 16, where in a description of
Gilgamesh, his strength is said to be &ldquo;strong like a mass (i.e.,
a meteor) of heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="#p.009">Line 9</a>. For <i>nu&scaron;&scaron;a&scaron;u
&ucirc;l ilt&ecirc;</i> we have a parallel in the Hebrew phrase
<span lang=
"he">&#1504;&#1500;&#1456;&#1463;&#1508;&#1464;&#1505;&#1461;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;

<p><a href="#p.010">Line 10</a>. <i>Uruk m&acirc;tum</i>, as the
designation for the district of Erech, occurs in the Assyrian version,
e.g., I, 5, 31, and IV, 2, 38; also to be supplied, I, 6, 23.</p>
<p>For <i lang="obab">pa&#7723;ir</i> the parallel in the Assyrian
version has <i lang="obab">iz-za-az</i> (I, 5, 31), but VI, 197, we
find <i lang="obab">pa&#7723;-ru</i> and <i lang=
"obab">pa&#7723;-ra</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#p.017">Line 17</a>. <i>mi-in-di</i> does not mean
&ldquo;truly&rdquo; as Langdon translates, but &ldquo;some one.&rdquo;
It occurs also in the Assyrian version X, 1, 13, <i lang=
"obab">mi-in-di-e ma-an-nu-&#7797;</i>, &ldquo;this is some one
who,&rdquo; etc. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="p70" href="#p70" name=

<p><a href="#p.018">Line 18</a>. Cf. Assyrian version I, 5, 3, and IV,
4, 7, <i lang="obab">ina &#7779;iri &acirc;lid</i>&mdash;both passages
referring to Enkidu.</p>
<p><a href="#p.021">Line 21</a>. Cf. Assyrian version II,
3<sup>b</sup>, 38, with <i>malk&ecirc;</i>, &ldquo;kings,&rdquo; as a
synonym of <i lang="obab">itlutum</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#p.023">Line 23</a>. <i lang=
"obab">ta-tar-ra-as-s&uacute;</i> from <i lang=
"obab">tar&acirc;&#7779;u</i>, &ldquo;direct,&rdquo;
&ldquo;guide,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p><a href="#p.024">Line 24</a>. I take <i lang=
"obab">u&scaron;-ti-nim-ma</i> as III, 2, from <i lang=
"obab">i&scaron;&ecirc;nu</i> (<span lang=
"he">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1503;&lrm;</span>), the verb
underlying <i lang="obab">&scaron;ittu</i>, &ldquo;sleep,&rdquo; and
<i lang="obab">&scaron;uttu</i>, &ldquo;dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="#p.026">Line 26</a>. Cf. Assyrian version I, 6, 21&mdash;a
complete parallel.</p>
<p><a href="#p.028">Line 28</a>. <i lang="obab">Uruk ri-bi-tim</i>, the
standing phrase in both tablets of the old Babylonian version, for
which in the Assyrian version we have <i lang="obab">Uruk su-pu-ri</i>.
The former term suggests the &ldquo;broad space&rdquo; outside of the
city or the &ldquo;common&rdquo; in a village community, while <i lang=
"obab">sup&ucirc;ri</i>, &ldquo;enclosed,&rdquo; would refer to the
city within the walls. Dr. W. F. Albright (in a private communication)
suggests &ldquo;Erech of the plazas&rdquo; as a suitable translation
for <i lang="obab">Uruk rib&icirc;tim</i>. A third term, <i lang=
"obab">Uruk m&acirc;tum</i> (see above, note to line 10), though
designating rather the district of which Erech was the capital, appears
to be used as a synonym to <i lang="obab">Uruk rib&icirc;tim</i>, as
may be concluded from the phrase <i lang="obab">i-na ri-bi-tum
ma-ti</i> (l. 214 of the Pennsylvania tablet), which clearly means the
&ldquo;plaza&rdquo; of the city. One naturally thinks of <span lang=
"he">&#1512;&#1456;&#1495;&#1465;&#1489;&#1465;&#1514;
&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&lrm;</span> in <a class="biblink xd26e190"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen%2010:11&amp;version=NRSV">
Genesis 10, 11</a>&mdash;the equivalent of Babylonian <i lang=
"obab">ri-bi-tu &acirc;li</i>&mdash;which can hardly be the name of a
city. It appears to be a gloss, as is <span lang=
"he">&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1463;&#1508;&#1464;&#1505;
&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;
&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;&lrm;</span>
at the end of v. 12. The latter gloss is misplaced, since it clearly
describes &ldquo;Nineveh,&rdquo; mentioned in v. 11. Inasmuch as
<span lang="he">&#1512;&#1456;&#1495;&#1465;&#1489;&#1465;&#1514;
&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&lrm;</span> immediately follows the
mention of Nineveh, it seems simplest to take the phrase as designating
the &ldquo;outside&rdquo; or &ldquo;suburbs&rdquo; of the city, a
complete parallel, therefore, to <i lang="obab">ri-bi-tu m&acirc;ti</i>
in our text. Nineveh, together with the &ldquo;suburbs,&rdquo; forms
the &ldquo;great city.&rdquo; <i lang="obab">Uruk rib&icirc;tim</i> is,
therefore, a designation for &ldquo;greater Erech,&rdquo; proper to a
capital city, which by its gradual growth would take in more than its
original confines. &ldquo;Erech of the plazas&rdquo; must have come to
be used as a honorific designation of this important center as early as
2000 B. C., whereas later, perhaps because of its decline, the epithet
no longer seemed appropriate and was replaced by the more modest
designation of &ldquo;walled Erech,&rdquo; with an allusion to the
tradition which ascribed the building of the wall of the city to
Gilgamesh. At all <span class="pagenum">[<a id="p71" href="#p71" name=
"p71">71</a>]</span>events, all three expressions, &ldquo;Erech of the
plazas,&rdquo; &ldquo;Erech walled&rdquo; and &ldquo;Erech land,&rdquo;
are to be regarded as synonymous. The position once held by Erech
follows also from its ideographic designation (Br&uuml;nnow No. 4796)
by the sign &ldquo;house&rdquo; with a &ldquo;gunufied&rdquo;
extension, which conveys the idea of Unu = <i lang=
"obab">&scaron;ubtu</i>, or &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; <i>par
excellence</i>. The pronunciation Unug or Unuk (see the gloss <i lang=
"obab">u-nu-uk</i>, VR 23, 8<sup>a</sup>), composed of <i lang=
"obab">unu</i>, &ldquo;dwelling,&rdquo; and <i lang="obab">ki</i>,
&ldquo;place,&rdquo; is hardly to be regarded as older than Uruk, which
is to be resolved into <i lang="obab">uru</i>, &ldquo;city,&rdquo; and
<i lang="obab">ki</i>, &ldquo;place,&rdquo; but rather as a play upon
the name, both Unu + ki and Uru + ki conveying the same idea of
<i>the</i> city or <i>the</i> dwelling place <i>par excellence</i>. As
the seat of the second oldest dynasty according to Babylonian
traditions (see Poebel&rsquo;s list in <i>Historical and Grammatical
Texts</i> No. 2), Erech no doubt was regarded as having been at one
time &ldquo;the city,&rdquo; i.e., the capital of the entire Euphrates
Valley.</p>
<p><a href="#p.031">Line 31</a>. A difficult line for which Langdon
proposes the translation: &ldquo;Another axe seemed his
visage&rdquo;!!&mdash;which may be picturesque, but hardly a
description befitting a hero. How can a man&rsquo;s face seem to be an
axe? Langdon attaches <i lang="obab">&scaron;&aacute;-ni</i> in the
sense of &ldquo;second&rdquo; to the preceding word &ldquo;axe,&rdquo;
whereas <i lang="obab">&scaron;an&icirc; bunu&scaron;u</i>,
&ldquo;change of his countenance&rdquo; or &ldquo;his countenance being
changed,&rdquo; is to be taken as a phrase to convey the idea of
&ldquo;being disturbed,&rdquo; &ldquo;displeased&rdquo; or
&ldquo;angry.&rdquo; The phrase is of the same kind as the well-known
<i lang="obab">&scaron;unnu &#7789;&ecirc;mu</i>, &ldquo;changing of
reason,&rdquo; to denote &ldquo;insanity.&rdquo; See the passages in
Muss-Arnolt, <i>Assyrian Dictionary</i>, pp. 355 and 1068. In Hebrew,
too, we have the same two phrases, e.g., <span lang=

Dan. 3, 19</a>, &ldquo;The form of his visage was changed,&rdquo;
meaning &ldquo;he was enraged.&rdquo; Fortunately, the same phrase
occurs also in the Yale tablet (l. 192), <i lang=
"obab">&scaron;&aacute;-nu-&uacute; bu-nu-&scaron;&uacute;</i>, in a
connection which leaves no doubt that the aroused fury of the tyrant
&#7722;uwawa is described by it:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&rdquo;&#7722;uwawa heard and his face was

<p class="first">precisely, therefore, as we should say&mdash;following

countenance <span class="pagenum">[<a id="p72" href="#p72" name=
"p72">72</a>]</span>was darkened&rdquo; (Assyrian version I, 2, 48), to
express &ldquo;anger.&rdquo; The line, therefore, in the Pennsylvania
tablet must describe Enkidu&rsquo;s anger. With the brandishing of the
axe the hero&rsquo;s anger was also stirred up. The touch was added to
prepare us for the continuation in which Gish describes how, despite
this (or perhaps just because of it), Enkidu seemed so attractive that
Gish instantly fell in love with him. May perhaps the emphatic form
<i lang="obab">&#7723;a&#7779;inumma</i> (line 31) against <i lang=
"obab">&#7723;a&#7779;inu</i> (line 29) have been used to indicate
&ldquo;The axe it was,&rdquo; or &ldquo;because of the axe?&rdquo; It
would be worth while to examine other texts of the Hammurabi period
with a view of determining the scope in the use and meaning of the
emphatic <i>ma</i> when added to a substantive.</p>
<p><a href="#p.032">Line 32</a>. The combination <i lang="obab">amur

<p><a href="#p.038">Lines 38</a>&ndash;40, completing the column, may
be supplied from the Assyrian version I, 6, 30&ndash;32, in conjunction

<p class="first">enables us to restore also the beginning of the second
tablet of the Assyrian version (cf. the colophon of the fragment 81,

p. 134),</p>

<p class="first"><a href="#p.044">Line 44</a>. The restoration of this
line is largely conjectural, based on the supposition that its contents
correspond in a general way to I, 4, 16, of the Assyrian version. The
reading <i lang="obab">di-da</i> is quite certain, as is also <i lang=
"obab">ip-ti-[e]</i>; and since both words occur in the line of the
Assyrian version in question, it is tempting to supply at the beginning
<i lang="obab">ur-[&scaron;&aacute;]</i> = &ldquo;her loins&rdquo; (cf.
Holma, <i lang="de">Namen der K&ouml;rperteile</i>, etc., p. 101),
which is likewise found in the same line of the Assyrian version. At
all events the line describes the fascination exercised <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="p73" href="#p73" name="p73">73</a>]</span>upon Enkidu
by the woman&rsquo;s bodily charms, which make him forget everything
else.</p>
<p><a href="#p.046">Lines 46</a>&ndash;47 form a parallel to I, 4, 21,
of the Assyrian version. The form <i lang="obab">&scaron;amkatu</i>,
&ldquo;courtesan,&rdquo; is constant in the old Babylonian version (ll.
135 and 172), as against <i lang="obab">&scaron;am&#7723;atu</i> in the
Assyrian version (I, 3, 19, 40, 45; 4, 16), which also uses the plural
<i lang="obab">&scaron;am-&#7723;a-a-ti</i> (II, 3<sup>b</sup>, 40).
The interchange between <i>&#7723;</i> and <i>k</i> is not without
precedent (cf. Meissner, <i lang="de">Altbabylonisches Privatrecht</i>,
page 107, note 2, and more particularly Chiera, <i>List of Personal
Names</i>, page 37).</p>
<p>In view of the evidence, set forth in the <a href=
"#intro">Introduction</a>, for the assumption that the Enkidu story has
been combined with a tale of the evolution of primitive man to
civilized life, it is reasonable to suggest that in the original Enkidu
story the female companion was called <i lang=
"obab">&scaron;amkatu</i>, &ldquo;courtesan,&rdquo; whereas in the tale
of the primitive man, which was transferred to Enkidu, the associate
was <i lang="obab">&#7723;arimtu</i>, a &ldquo;woman,&rdquo; just as in
the Genesis tale, the companion of Adam is simply called <i lang=
"obab">ishsh&acirc;</i>, &ldquo;woman.&rdquo; Note that in the Assyrian
parallel (Tablet I, 4, 26) we have two readings, <i lang=
"obab">ir-&#7723;i</i> (imperf.) and a variant <i lang=
"obab">i-ri-&#7723;i</i> (present). The former is the better reading,
as our tablet shows.</p>
<p><a href="#p.049">Lines 49</a>&ndash;59 run parallel to the Assyrian
version I, 4, 33&ndash;38, with slight variations which have been
discussed above, p. 58, and from which we may conclude that the
Assyrian version represents an independent redaction. Since in our
tablet we have presumably the repetition of what may have been in part
at least set forth in the first tablet of the old Babylonian version,
we must not press the parallelism with the first tablet of the Assyrian
version too far; but it is noticeable nevertheless (1) that our tablet
contains lines 57&ndash;58 which are not represented in the Assyrian
version, and (2) that the second speech of the &ldquo;woman&rdquo;
beginning, line 62, with <i lang="obab">al-ka</i>, &ldquo;come&rdquo;
(just as the first speech, line 54), is likewise not found in the first
tablet of the Assyrian version; which on the other hand contains a line
(39) not in the Babylonian version, besides the detailed answer of
Enkidu (I 4, 42&ndash;5, 5). Line 6, which reads &ldquo;Enkidu and the
woman went (<i lang="obab">il-li-ku</i>) to walled Erech,&rdquo; is
also not found in the second tablet of the old Babylonian version.</p>
<p><a href="#p.063">Line 63</a>. For <i lang="obab">magr&ucirc;</i>,
&ldquo;accursed,&rdquo; see the frequent use in Astrological texts
(Jastrow, <i lang="de">Religion Babyloniens und Assyriens</i> II, page
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="p74" href="#p74" name=
"p74">74</a>]</span>450, note 2). Langdon, by his strange error in
separating <i lang="obab">ma-a-ag-ri-im</i> into two words <i lang=
"obab">ma-a-ak</i> and <i lang="obab">ri-i-im</i>, with a still
stranger rendering: &ldquo;unto the place yonder of the
shepherds!!&rdquo;, naturally misses the point of this important
speech.</p>
<p><a href="#p.064">Line 64</a> corresponds to I, 4, 40, of the
Assyrian version, which has an additional line, leading to the answer
of Enkidu. From here on, our tablet furnishes material not represented
in the Assyrian version, but which was no doubt included in the second
tablet of that version of which we have only a few fragments.</p>
<p><a href="#p.070">Line 70</a> must be interpreted as indicating that
the woman kept one garment for herself. <i lang=
"obab">Ittalba&scaron;</i> would accordingly mean, &ldquo;she kept
on.&rdquo; The female dress appears to have consisted of an upper and a
lower garment.</p>
<p><a href="#p.072">Line 72</a>. The restoration &ldquo;like a
god&rdquo; is favored by <a href="#p.051">line 51</a>, where Enkidu is
likened to a god, and is further confirmed by l. 190.</p>
<p><a href="#p.073">Line 73</a>. <i lang="obab">gupru</i> is identical
with <i lang="obab">gu-up-ri</i> (Thompson, <i>Reports of the Magicians
and Astrologers</i>, etc., 223 rev. 2 and 223<sup>a</sup> rev. 8), and
must be correlated to <i lang="obab">gip&acirc;ru</i> (Muss-Arnolt,
<i>Assyrian Dictionary</i>, p. 229<sup>a</sup>), &ldquo;planted
field,&rdquo; &ldquo;meadow,&rdquo; and the like. Thompson&rsquo;s
translation &ldquo;men&rdquo; (as though a synonym of <i lang=
"obab">gabru</i>) is to be corrected accordingly.</p>
<p><a href="#p.074">Line 74</a>. There is nothing missing between
<i lang="obab">a-&scaron;ar</i> and <i lang=
"obab">tar-ba-&#7779;i-im</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#p.075">Line 75</a>. <i lang="obab">ri-ia-&uacute;</i>,
which Langdon renders &ldquo;shepherd,&rdquo; is the equivalent of the
Arabic <i lang="ar-latn">ri&#703;y</i> and Hebrew <span lang=
"he">&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&lrm;</span>
&ldquo;pasturage,&rdquo; &ldquo;fodder.&rdquo; We have usually the
feminine form <i lang="obab">ri-i-tu</i> (Muss-Arnolt, <i>Assyrian
Dictionary</i>, p. 990<sup>b</sup>). The break at the end of the second
column is not serious. Evidently Enkidu, still accustomed to live like
an animal, is first led to the sheepfolds, and this suggests a
repetition of the description of his former life. Of the four or five
lines missing, we may conjecturally restore four, on the basis of the
Assyrian version, Tablet I, 4, 2&ndash;5, or I, 2, 39&ndash;41. This
would then join on well to the beginning of column 3.</p>
<p><a href="#p.081">Line 81</a>. Both here and in <a href="#p.052">l.
52</a> our text has <i lang="obab">na-ma-&aacute;&scaron;-te-e</i>, as
against <i lang="obab">nam-ma&scaron;-&scaron;i-i</i> in the Assyrian
version, e.g., Tablet I, 2, 41; 4, 5, etc.,&mdash;the feminine form,
therefore, as against the masculine. Langdon&rsquo;s note 3 on page 213
is misleading. In astrological texts we also find <i lang=
"obab">nam-ma&scaron;-te</i>; e.g., Thompson, <i>Reports of the
Magicians and Astrologers</i>, etc., No. 200, Obv. 2. <span class=

<i lang="obab">simat</i>) <i lang="obab">ba-la-&#7789;i-im</i> is not
&ldquo;conformity of life&rdquo; as Langdon renders, but that which
&ldquo;belongs to life&rdquo; like <i lang="obab">si-mat

the Assyrian version III, 2<sup>a</sup>, 3 (Jensen, page 146).
&ldquo;Food,&rdquo; says the woman, &ldquo;is the staff of

<p><a href="#p.094">Line 94</a>. Langdon&rsquo;s strange rendering
&ldquo;of the conditions and fate of the land&rdquo; rests upon an
erroneous reading (see the corrections, Appendix I), which is the more
inexcusable because in line 97 the same ideogram, K&agrave;&scaron; =
<i lang="obab">&scaron;ikaru</i>, &ldquo;wine,&rdquo; occurs, and is
correctly rendered by him. <i lang="obab">&Scaron;imti m&acirc;ti</i>

sense of &ldquo;times,&rdquo; is a well-known word for a large
&ldquo;goblet,&rdquo; which occurs in Incantation texts, e.g.,
<i>CT</i> XVI, 24, obv. 1, 19, <i lang="obab">m&ecirc;
a-&#7779;a-am-mi-e &scaron;&uacute;-puk</i>, &ldquo;pour out goblets of

<p><a href="#p.103">Line 103</a>. Langdon has correctly rendered

&ldquo;the head and hair of the feet&rdquo; (euphemistic for the hair
around the privates), as an explanatory gloss to the rare word
<span lang="he">&#1513;&#1499;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;&lrm;</span> for
&ldquo;hair&rdquo; of the body in general&mdash;just as in the passage
in the Pennsylvania tablet. The verse in Isaiah would then read,
&ldquo;The Lord on that day will shave with the razor the hair
(<span lang=
"he">&#1492;&#1513;&#1499;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;&lrm;</span>), and even
the beard will be removed.&rdquo; The rest of the verse would represent
a series of explanatory glosses: (a) &ldquo;Beyond the river&rdquo;
(i.e., Assyria), a gloss to <span lang=
"he">&#1497;&#1456;&#1490;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&lrm;</span>
(b) &ldquo;with the king of Assyria,&rdquo; a gloss to <span lang=

&ldquo;with a razor;&rdquo; and (c) &ldquo;the hair of the head and
hair of the feet,&rdquo; a gloss to <span lang=
"he">&#1492;&#1513;&#1499;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;&lrm;</span>. For
&ldquo;hair of the feet&rdquo; we have an interesting equivalent in
Babylonian <i lang="obab">&scaron;u-&#7723;ur</i> (and <i lang=
"obab">&scaron;&uacute;-&#7723;u-ur</i>) <i lang=
"obab">&scaron;&ecirc;pi</i> (<i>CT</i> XII, 41, 23&ndash;24 c-d). Cf.
also Boissier, <i lang="fr">Documents Assyriens relatifs aux
Pr&eacute;sages</i>, p. 258, 4&ndash;5. The Babylonian phrase is like
the Hebrew one to be interpreted as a euphemism for the hair around the
male or female organ. To be sure, the change from <span lang=
"he">&#1492;&lrm;</span> to <span lang="he">&#1499;&lrm;</span> in
<span lang="he">&#1492;&#1513;&#1499;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;&lrm;</span>
constitutes an objection, but not a serious one in the case of a
loan-word, which would aim to give the <i>pronunciation</i> of the
original word, rather than the correct etymological equivalent. The
writing with aspirated <span lang="he">&#1499;&lrm;</span> fulfills
this condition. (Cf. <i>&scaron;amkatum</i> and
<i>&scaron;am&#7723;atum</i>, above p. 73). The passage in Isaiah being
a reference to Assyria, the prophet might be tempted to use a foreign
word to make his point more emphatic. To take <span lang=
"he">&#1492;&#1513;&#1499;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;&lrm;</span> as
&ldquo;hired,&rdquo; as has hitherto been done, and to translate
&ldquo;with a hired razor,&rdquo; is not only to suppose a very wooden
metaphor, but is grammatically difficult, since <span lang=
"he">&#1492;&#1513;&#1499;&#1497;&#1512;&#1495;&lrm;</span> would be a
feminine adjective attached to a masculine substantive.</p>
<p>Coming back to our passage in the Pennsylvania tablet, it is to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="p77" href="#p77" name=
"p77">77</a>]</span>be noted that Enkidu is described as covered
&ldquo;all over his body with hair&rdquo; (Assyrian version, Tablet I,
2, 36) like an animal. To convert him into a civilized man, the hair is
removed.</p>
<p><a href="#p.107">Line 107</a>. <i lang="obab">mutu</i> does not mean
&ldquo;husband&rdquo; here, as Langdon supposes, but must be taken as
in <a href="#p.238">l. 238</a> in the more general sense of
&ldquo;man,&rdquo; for which there is good evidence.</p>
<p><a href="#p.109">Line 109</a>. <i lang="obab">la-bi</i> (plural

Langdon has it. The verb <i lang="obab">&uacute;-gi-ir-ri</i> is from
<i lang="obab">g&acirc;ru</i>, &ldquo;to attack.&rdquo; Langdon by
separating <i>&uacute;</i> from <i lang="obab">gi-ir-ri</i> gets a
totally wrong and indeed absurd meaning. See the corrections in the

of course is impossible.</p>

"obab">u&scaron;-sa-ak-pu</i>, III, 1, of <i lang=
"obab">sak&acirc;pu</i>, which is frequently used for &ldquo;lying
down&rdquo; and is in fact a synonym of <i lang=
"obab">&#7779;al&acirc;lu</i>. See Muss-Arnolt, <i>Assyrian
Dictionary</i>, page 758<sup>a</sup>. The original has very clearly
S&iacute;b (= <i lang="obab">r&ecirc;&rsquo;u</i>,
&ldquo;shepherd&rdquo;) with the plural sign. The &ldquo;shepherds of
the night,&rdquo; who could now rest since Enkidu had killed the lions,
are of course the shepherds who were accustomed to watch the flocks
during the night.</p>
<p><a href="#p.111">Line 111</a>. <i lang=
"obab">ut-tap-pi-i&scaron;</i> is II, 2, <i lang=
"obab">nap&acirc;&scaron;u</i>, &ldquo;to make a hole,&rdquo; hence
&ldquo;to plunge&rdquo; in connection with a weapon. <i lang=
"obab">&Scaron;ib-ba-ri</i> is, of course, not &ldquo;mountain
goats,&rdquo; as Langdon renders, but a by-form to <i lang=
"obab">&scaron;ibbiru</i>, &ldquo;stick,&rdquo; and designates some
special weapon. Since on seal cylinders depicting Enkidu killing lions
and other animals the hero is armed with a dagger, this is presumably
the weapon <i lang="obab">&scaron;ibbaru</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#p.113">Line 113</a>. Langdon&rsquo;s translation is again
out of the question and purely fanciful. The traces favor the
restoration <i lang="obab">na-ki-[di-e]</i>, &ldquo;shepherds,&rdquo;
and since the line appears to be a parallel to line 110, I venture to
suggest at the beginning <i lang="obab">[it-ti]-lu</i> from <i lang=
"obab">na&rsquo;&acirc;lu</i>, &ldquo;lie down&rdquo;&mdash;a synonym,
therefore, to <i lang="obab">sak&acirc;pu</i> in line 110. The
shepherds can sleep quietly after Enkidu has become the
&ldquo;guardian&rdquo; of the flocks. In the Assyrian version (tablet
II, 3<sup>a</sup>, 4) Enkidu is called a <i lang="obab">na-kid</i>,
&ldquo;shepherd,&rdquo; and in the preceding line we likewise have
<sup>l&ugrave;</sup>Na-Kid with the plural sign, i.e.,
&ldquo;shepherds.&rdquo; This would point to <i lang="obab">nakidu</i>
being a Sumerian loan-word, unless it is <i>vice versa</i>, a word that
has gone over into the Sumerian from Akkadian. Is perhaps the fragment
in question (K 8574) in the Assyrian version (Haupt&rsquo;s ed. No. 25)
the <i>parallel</i> to our passage? If in line 4 of this fragment we
could read <i lang="obab">&scaron;&uacute;</i> for <i lang=
"obab">sa</i>, i.e., <i lang="obab">na-kid-&scaron;&uacute;-nu</i>,
&ldquo;their shepherd, we would have a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"p78" href="#p78" name="p78">78</a>]</span>parallel to line 114 of the
Pennsylvania tablet, with <i>na-kid</i> as a synonym to <i lang=
"obab">ma&#7779;&#7779;aru</i>, &ldquo;protector.&rdquo; The preceding
line would then be completed as follows:</p>
<div lang="obab" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>[it-ti-lu]-nim-ma na-kid<sup>me&scaron;</sup>
[ra-bu-tum]</i></p>
</div>
<p class="first">(or perhaps only <i lang="obab">it-ti-lu-ma</i>, since
the <i lang="obab">nim</i> is not certain) and would correspond to
<a href="#p.113">line 113</a> of the Pennsylvania tablet. Inasmuch as
the writing on the tiny fragment is very much blurred, it is quite
possible that in line 2 we must read <i lang=
"obab">&scaron;ib-ba-ri</i> (instead of <i lang="obab">bar-ba-ri</i>),
which would furnish a parallel to line 111 of the Pennsylvania tablet.
The difference between Bar and &Scaron;ib is slight, and the one sign
might easily be mistaken for the other in the case of close writing.
The continuation of line 2 of the fragment would then correspond to
line 112 of the Pennsylvania tablet, while line 1 of the fragment might
be completed <i lang="obab">[re-e]-u-ti(?) &scaron;&aacute;
[mu-&scaron;i-a-tim]</i>, though this is by no means certain.</p>
<p>The break at the close of column 3 (about 5 lines) and the top of
column 4 (about 8 lines) is a most serious interruption in the
narrative, and makes it difficult to pick up the thread where the
tablet again becomes readable. We cannot be certain whether the
&ldquo;strong man, the unique hero&rdquo; who addresses some one (lines
115&ndash;117) is Enkidu or Gish or some other personage, but
presumably Gish is meant. In the Assyrian version, Tablet I, 3, 2 and
29, we find Gilgamesh described as the &ldquo;unique hero&rdquo; and in
l. 234 of the Pennsylvania tablet Gish is called &ldquo;unique,&rdquo;
while again, in the Assyrian version, Tablet I, 2, 15 and 26, he is
designated as <i lang="obab">ga&scaron;ru</i> as in our text. Assuming
this, whom does he address? Perhaps the shepherds? In either case he
receives an answer that rejoices him. If the fragment of the Assyrian
version (K 8574) above discussed is the equivalent to the close of
column 3 of the Pennsylvania tablet, we may go one step further, and
with some measure of assurance assume that Gish is told of
Enkidu&rsquo;s exploits and that the latter is approaching Erech. This
pleases Gish, but Enkidu when he sees Gish(?) is stirred to anger and
wants to annihilate him. At this point, the &ldquo;man&rdquo; (who is
probably Gish, though the possibility of a third personage must be
admitted) intervenes and in a long speech sets forth the destiny and
higher aims of mankind. The contrast between Enkidu and Gish (or the
third party) is that between the primitive <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="p79" href="#p79" name="p79">79</a>]</span>savage and
the civilized being. The contrast is put in the form of an opposition
between the two. The primitive man is the stronger and wishes to
destroy the one whom he regards as a natural foe and rival. On the
other hand, the one who stands on a higher plane wants to lift his
fellow up. The whole of column 4, therefore, forms part of the lesson
attached to the story of Enkidu, who, identified with man in a
primitive stage, is made the medium of illustrating how the higher
plane is reached through the guiding influences of the woman&rsquo;s
hold on man, an influence exercised, to be sure, with the help of her
bodily charms.</p>
<p><a href="#p.135">Line 135</a>. <i lang="obab">uk-ki-&scaron;i</i>
(imperative form) does not mean &ldquo;take away,&rdquo; as Langdon
(who entirely misses the point of the whole passage) renders, but on
the contrary, &ldquo;lure him on,&rdquo; &ldquo;entrap him,&rdquo; and
the like. The verb occurs also in the Yale tablet, ll. 183 and 186.</p>
<p><a href="#p.137">Line 137</a>. Langdon&rsquo;s note to <i lang=
"obab">lu-u&scaron;-&scaron;&uacute;</i> had better be passed over in
silence. The form is II. 1, from <i lang="obab">e&scaron;&ucirc;</i>,
&ldquo;destroy.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="#p.139">Line 139</a>. Since the man whom the woman calls
approaches Enkidu, the subject of both verbs is the man, and the object
is Enkidu; i.e., therefore, &ldquo;The man approaches Enkidu and
beholds him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="#p.140">Line 140</a>. Langdon&rsquo;s interpretation of
this line again is purely fanciful. <i lang="obab">E-di-il</i> cannot,
of course, be a &ldquo;phonetic variant&rdquo; of <i lang=
"obab">edir</i>; and certainly the line does not describe the state of
mind of the woman. Lines 140&ndash;141 are to be taken as an expression
of amazement at Enkidu&rsquo;s appearance. The first word appears to be
an imperative in the sense of &ldquo;Be off,&rdquo; &ldquo;Away,&rdquo;
from <i lang="obab">d&acirc;lu</i>, &ldquo;move, roam.&rdquo; The
second word <i lang="obab">e-e&scaron;</i>, &ldquo;why,&rdquo; occurs
with the same verb <i lang="obab">d&acirc;lu</i> in the Meissner
fragment: <i lang="obab">e-e&scaron; ta-da-al</i> (column 3, 1),
&ldquo;why dost thou roam about?&rdquo; The verb at the end of the line
may perhaps be completed to <i lang="obab">ta-&#7723;i-il-la-am</i>.
The last sign appears to be <i>am</i>, but may be <i lang=
"obab">ma</i>, in which case we should have to complete simply <i lang=
"obab">ta-&#7723;i-il-ma</i>. <i lang="obab">Ta&#7723;&icirc;l</i>
would be the second person present of <i lang=
"obab">&#7723;&icirc;lu</i>. Cf. <i lang="obab">i-&#7723;i-il</i>,
frequently in astrological texts, e.g., Virolleaud, <i>Adad</i> No. 3,
lines 21 and 33.</p>
<p><a href="#p.141">Line 141</a>. The reading <i lang="obab">lim-nu</i>
at the beginning, instead of Langdon&rsquo;s <i lang="obab">mi-nu</i>,
is quite certain, as is also <i lang="obab">ma-na-a&#7723;-ti-ka</i>
instead of what Langdon proposes, which gives no sense whatever.
<i lang="obab">Mana&#7723;tu</i> in the sense of the &ldquo;toil&rdquo;
and &ldquo;activity of life&rdquo; (like <span lang=
"he">&#1506;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1500;&lrm;</span> throughout the
Book of Ecclesiastes) occurs in the introductory lines to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="p80" href="#p80" name="p80">80</a>]</span>the
Assyrian version of the Epic I, 1, 8, <i lang="obab">ka-lu
ma-na-a&#7723;-ti-[&scaron;u]</i>, &ldquo;all of his toil,&rdquo; i.e.,
all of his career.</p>
<p><a href="#p.142">Line 142</a>. The subject of the verb cannot be the
woman, as Langdon supposes, for the text in that case, e.g., line 49,
would have said <i lang="obab">pi-&scaron;&aacute;</i> (&ldquo;her
mouth&rdquo;) not <i lang="obab">pi-&scaron;&uacute;</i> (&ldquo;his
mouth&rdquo;). The long speech, detailing the function and destiny of
civilized man, is placed in the mouth of the man who meets Enkidu.</p>
<p>In the <a href="#intro">Introduction</a> it has been pointed out
that <a href="#p.149">lines 149</a> and <a href="#p.151">151</a> of the
speech appear to be due to later modifications of the speech designed
to connect the episode with Gish. Assuming this to be the case, the
speech sets forth the following five distinct aims of human life: (1)
establishing a home (line 144), (2) work (line 147), (3) storing up
resources (line 148), (4) marriage (line 150), (5) monogamy (line 154);
all of which is put down as established for all time by divine decree
(lines 155&ndash;157), and as man&rsquo;s fate from his birth (lines
158&ndash;159).</p>
<p><a href="#p.144">Line 144</a>. <i lang="obab">bi-ti-i&scaron;
e-mu-ti</i> is for <i lang="obab">b&icirc;ti &scaron;&aacute;
e-mu-ti</i>, just as <i lang="obab">&#7731;ab-lu-u&scaron;
Ti-a-ma-ti</i> (Assyrian Creation Myth, IV, 65) stands for <i lang=
"obab">&#7731;ablu &scaron;&aacute; Tiamti</i>. Cf. <i lang=
"obab">b&icirc;t e-mu-ti</i> (Assyrian version, IV, 2, 46 and 48). The
end of the line is lost beyond recovery, but the general sense is
clear.</p>
<p><a href="#p.146">Line 146</a>. <i lang="obab">tu-a-ar</i> is a
possible reading. It may be the construct of <i lang=
"obab">tu-a-ru</i>, of frequent occurrence in legal texts and having
some such meaning as &ldquo;right,&rdquo; &ldquo;claim&rdquo; or
&ldquo;prerogative.&rdquo; See the passages given by Muss-Arnolt,
<i>Assyrian Dictionary</i>, p. 1139<sup>b</sup>.</p>
<p><a href="#p.148">Line 148</a>. The reading <i lang=
"obab">uk-la-at</i>, &ldquo;food,&rdquo; and then in the wider sense
&ldquo;food supply,&rdquo; &ldquo;provisions,&rdquo; is quite certain.
The fourth sign looks like the one for &ldquo;city.&rdquo; <i lang=
"obab">E-mi-sa</i> may stand for <i lang="obab">e-mid-sa</i>,
&ldquo;place it.&rdquo; The general sense of the line, at all events,
is clear, as giving the advice to gather resources. It fits in with the
Babylonian outlook on life to regard work and wealth as the fruits of
work and as a proper purpose in life.</p>
<p><a href="#p.150">Line 150</a> (repeated <a href="#p.152">lines
152</a>&ndash;153) is a puzzling line. To render <i lang="obab">piti
p&ucirc;k ep&scaron;i</i> (or <i lang="obab">epi&scaron;i</i>), as
Langdon proposes, &ldquo;open, addressing thy speech,&rdquo; is
philologically and in every other respect inadmissible. The word
<i lang="obab">pu-uk</i> (which Langdon takes for &ldquo;thy
mouth&rdquo;!!) can, of course, be nothing but the construct form of
<i lang="obab">pukku</i>, which occurs in the Assyrian version in the
sense of &ldquo;net&rdquo; (<i lang="obab">pu-uk-ku</i> I, 2, 9 and 21,
and also in the colophon to the eleventh tablet furnishing the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="p81" href="#p81" name=
"p81">81</a>]</span>beginning of the twelfth tablet (Haupt&rsquo;s
edition No. 56), as well as in column 2, 29, and column 3, 6, of this
twelfth tablet). In the two last named passages <i lang=
"obab">pukku</i> is a synonym of <i lang="obab">mek&ucirc;</i>, which
from the general meaning of &ldquo;enclosure&rdquo; comes to be a
euphemistic expression for the female organ. So, for example, in the
Assyrian Creation Myth, Tablet IV, 66 (synonym of <i lang=
"obab">&#7731;ablu</i>, &ldquo;waist,&rdquo; etc.). See Holma, <i lang=
"de">Namen der K&ouml;rperteile</i>, page 158. Our word <i>pukku</i>
must be taken in this same sense as a designation of the female
organ&mdash;perhaps more specifically the &ldquo;hymen&rdquo; as the
&ldquo;net,&rdquo; though the womb in general might also be designated
as a &ldquo;net&rdquo; or &ldquo;enclosure.&rdquo; <i lang=
"obab">Kak-(&scaron;i)</i> is no doubt to be read <i lang=
"obab">ep&scaron;i</i>, as Langdon correctly saw; or perhaps better,
<i lang="obab">epi&scaron;i</i>. An expression like <i lang=
"obab">ip-&scaron;i-&scaron;&uacute; lul-la-a</i> (Assyrian version, I,
4, 13; also line 19, <i lang="obab">i-pu-us-su-ma lul-la-a</i>), with
the explanation <i lang="obab">&scaron;ipir zinni&scaron;ti</i>,
&ldquo;the work of woman&rdquo; (i.e., after the fashion of woman),
shows that <i lang="obab">ep&ecirc;&scaron;u</i> is used in connection
with the sexual act. The phrase <i lang="obab">pit&icirc; p&ucirc;k
epi&scaron;i a-na &#7723;a-a-a-ri</i>, literally &ldquo;open the net,
perform the act for marriage,&rdquo; therefore designates the
fulfillment of the marriage act, and the line is intended to point to
marriage with the accompanying sexual intercourse as one of the duties
of man. While the general meaning is thus clear, the introduction of
Gish is puzzling, except on the supposition that lines 149 and 151
represent later additions to connect the speech, detailing the advance
to civilized life, with the hero. See above, p. 45 <i>seq.</i></p>
<p><a href="#p.154">Line 154</a>. <i lang="obab">a&scaron;&scaron;at
&scaron;im&acirc;tim</i> is the &ldquo;legitimate wife,&rdquo; and the
line inculcates monogamy as against promiscuous sexual intercourse. We
know that monogamy was the rule in Babylonia, though a man could in
addition to the wife recognized as the legalized spouse take a
concubine, or his wife could give her husband a slave as a concubine.
Even in that case, according to the Hammurabi Code,
&sect;&sect;145&ndash;146, the wife retained her status. The Code
throughout assumes that a man has only <i>one</i> wife&mdash;the
<i lang="obab">a&scaron;&scaron;at &scaron;im&acirc;tim</i> of our
text. The phrase &ldquo;so&rdquo; (or &ldquo;that&rdquo;) before
&ldquo;as afterwards&rdquo; is to be taken as an idiomatic
expression&mdash;&ldquo;so it was and so it should be for all
times&rdquo;&mdash;somewhat like the phrase <i lang=
"obab">ma&#7723;riam &ugrave; arkiam</i>, &ldquo;for all times,&rdquo;
in legal documents (<i>CT</i> VIII, 38<sup>c</sup>, 22&ndash;23). For
the use of <i lang="obab">m&ucirc;k</i> see Behrens, <i lang=
"de">Assyrisch-Babylonische Briefe</i>, p. 3.</p>
<p><a href="#p.158">Line 158</a>. <i lang="obab">i-na bi-ti-i&#7731;
a-bu-un-na-ti-&scaron;&uacute;</i>. Another puzzling line, for which
Langdon proposes &ldquo;in the work of his presence,&rdquo; which
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="p82" href="#p82" name=
"p82">82</a>]</span>is as obscure as the original. In a note he says
that <i lang="obab">apunn&acirc;ti</i> means &ldquo;nostrils,&rdquo;
which is certainly wrong. There has been considerable discussion about
this term (see Holma, <i lang="de">Namen der K&ouml;rperteile</i>,
pages 150 and 157), the meaning of which has been advanced by
Christian&rsquo;s discussion in <i>OLZ</i> 1914, p. 397. From this it
appears that it must designate a part of the body which could acquire a
wider significance so as to be used as a synonym for
&ldquo;totality,&rdquo; since it appears in a list of equivalent for
Dur = <i lang="obab">nap-&#7723;a-ru</i>, &ldquo;totality,&rdquo;
<i lang="obab">ka-lu-ma</i>, &ldquo;all,&rdquo; <i lang=
"obab">a-bu-un-na-tum e-&#7779;i-im-tum</i>, &ldquo;bony
structure,&rdquo; and <i lang="obab">kul-la-tum</i>,
&ldquo;totality&rdquo; (<i>CT</i> XII, 10, 7&ndash;10). Christian shows
that it may be the &ldquo;navel,&rdquo; which could well acquire a
wider significance for the body in general; but we may go a step
further and specify the &ldquo;umbilical cord&rdquo; (tentatively
suggested also by Christian) as the primary meaning, then the
&ldquo;navel,&rdquo; and from this the &ldquo;body&rdquo; in general.
The structure of the umbilical cord as a series of strands would
account for designating it by a plural form <i lang=
"obab">abunn&acirc;ti</i>, as also for the fact that one could speak of
a right and left side of the <i lang="obab">appunn&acirc;ti</i>. To
distinguish between the &ldquo;umbilical cord&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;navel,&rdquo; the ideograph Dur (the common meaning of which is
<i lang="obab">riksu</i>, &ldquo;bond&rdquo; [Delitzsch, <i lang=
"de">Sumer. Glossar.</i>, p. 150]), was used for the former, while for
the latter Li Dur was employed, though the reading in Akkadian in both
cases was the same. The expression &ldquo;with (or at) the cutting of
his umbilical cord&rdquo; would mean, therefore, &ldquo;from his
birth&rdquo;&mdash;since the cutting of the cord which united the child
with the mother marks the beginning of the separate life. Lines
158&ndash;159, therefore, in concluding the address to Enkidu,
emphasize in a picturesque way that what has been set forth is
man&rsquo;s fate for which he has been destined from birth. [See now
Albright&rsquo;s remarks on <i lang="obab">abunnatu</i> in the
<span lang="fr">Revue d&rsquo;Assyriologie</span> 16, pp.
173&ndash;175, with whose conclusion, however, that it means primarily
&ldquo;backbone&rdquo; and then &ldquo;stature,&rdquo; I cannot
agree.]</p>
<p>In the break of about three lines at the bottom of column 4, and of
about six at the beginning of column 5, there must have been set forth
the effect of the address on Enkidu and the indication of his readiness
to accept the advice; as in a former passage (line 64), Enkidu showed
himself willing to follow the woman. At all events the two now proceed
to the heart of the city. Enkidu is in front <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="p83" href="#p83" name="p83">83</a>]</span>and the
woman behind him. The scene up to this point must have taken place
outside of Erech&mdash;in the suburbs or approaches to the city, where
the meadows and the sheepfolds were situated.</p>
<p><a href="#p.174">Line 174</a>. <i lang="obab">um-ma-nu-um</i> are
not the &ldquo;artisans,&rdquo; as Langdon supposes, but the
&ldquo;people&rdquo; of Erech, just as in the Assyrian version, Tablet
IV, 1, 40, where the word occurs in connection with <i lang=
"obab">i-dip-pi-ir</i>, which is perhaps to be taken as a synonym of
<i lang="obab">pa&#7723;&acirc;ru</i>, &ldquo;gather;&rdquo; so also
<i lang="obab">i-dip-pir</i> (Tablet I, 2, 40) &ldquo;gathers with the
flock.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="#p.180">Lines 180</a>&ndash;182 must have contained the
description of Enkidu&rsquo;s resemblance to Gish, but the lines are
too mutilated to permit of any certain restoration. See the corrections
(Appendix) for a suggested reading for the end of line 181.</p>
<p><a href="#p.183">Line 183</a> can be restored with considerable
probability on the basis of the Assyrian version, Tablet I, 3, 3 and
30, where Enkidu is described as one &ldquo;whose power is strong in
the land.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="#p.186">Lines 186</a>&ndash;187. The puzzling word, to be
read apparently <i lang="obab">kak-ki-a-tum</i>, can hardly mean
&ldquo;weapons,&rdquo; as Langdon proposes. In that case we should
expect <i lang="obab">kakk&ecirc;</i>; and, moreover, to so render
gives no sense, especially since the verb <i lang=
"obab">&uacute;-te-el-li-lu</i> is without much question to be rendered
&ldquo;rejoiced,&rdquo; and not &ldquo;purified.&rdquo; <i lang=
"obab">Kakkiatum</i>&mdash;if this be the correct reading&mdash;may be
a designation of Erech like <i lang="obab">rib&icirc;tim</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#p.188">Lines 188</a>&ndash;189 are again entirely
misunderstood by Langdon, owing to erroneous readings. See the
corrections in the Appendix.</p>
<p><a href="#p.190">Line 190</a>. <i lang="obab">i-li-im</i> in this
line is used like Hebrew Eloh&icirc;m, &ldquo;God.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="#p.191">Line 191</a>. <i lang=
"obab">&scaron;aki&scaron;&scaron;um</i> = <i lang=
"obab">&scaron;akin-&scaron;um</i>, as correctly explained by
Langdon.</p>
<p><a href="#p.192">Line 192</a>. With this line a new episode begins
which, owing to the gap at the beginning of column 6, is somewhat
obscure. The episode leads to the hostile encounter between Gish and
Enkidu. It is referred to in column 2 of the fourth tablet of the
Assyrian version. Lines 35&ndash;50&mdash;all that is preserved of this
column&mdash;form in part a parallel to columns 5&ndash;6 of the
Pennsylvania tablet, but in much briefer form, since what on the
Pennsylvania tablet is the incident itself is on the fourth tablet of
the Assyrian version merely a repeated summary of the relationship
between the two heroes, leading up to the expedition against
&#7722;u(m)baba. Lines 38&ndash;40 of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"p84" href="#p84" name="p84">84</a>]</span>column 2 of the Assyrian
version correspond to lines 174&ndash;177 of the Pennsylvania tablet,
and lines 44&ndash;50 to lines 192&ndash;221. It would seem that Gish
proceeds stealthily at night to go to the goddess Ish&#7723;ara, who
lies on a couch in the <i lang="obab">b&icirc;t &ecirc;muti</i>, the
&ldquo;family house&rdquo; Assyrian version, Tablet IV, 2.
46&ndash;48). He encounters Enkidu in the street, and the latter blocks
Gish&rsquo;s path, puts his foot in the gate leading to the house where
the goddess is, and thus prevents Gish from entering. Thereupon the two
have a fierce encounter in which Gish is worsted. The meaning of the
episode itself is not clear. Does Enkidu propose to deprive Gish, here
viewed as a god (cf. line 190 of the Pennsylvania tablet = Assyrian
version, Tablet I, 4, 45, &ldquo;like a god&rdquo;), of his spouse, the
goddess Ish&#7723;ara&mdash;another form of Ishtar? Or are the two
heroes, the one a counterpart of the other, contesting for the
possession of a goddess? Is it in this scene that Enkidu becomes the
&ldquo;rival&rdquo; (<i lang="obab">me-i&#7723;-r&ugrave;</i>, line 191
of the Pennsylvania tablet) of the divine Gish? We must content ourself
with having obtained through the Pennsylvania tablet a clearer
indication of the occasion of the fight between the two heroes, and
leave the further explanation of the episode till a fortunate chance
may throw additional light upon it. There is perhaps a reference to the
episode in the Assyrian version, Tablet II, 3<sup>b</sup>,
35&ndash;36.</p>
<p><a href="#p.196">Line 196</a>. For <i lang=
"obab">i-na-ag-&scaron;&aacute;-am</i> (from <i lang=
"obab">nag&acirc;&scaron;u</i>), Langdon proposes the purely fanciful
&ldquo;embracing her in sleep,&rdquo; whereas it clearly means
&ldquo;he approaches.&rdquo; Cf. Muss-Arnolt, <i>Assyrian
Dictionary</i>, page 645<sup>a</sup>.</p>
<p><a href="#p.197">Lines 197</a>&ndash;200 appear to correspond to
Tablet IV, 2, 35&ndash;37, of the Assyrian version, though not forming
a complete parallel. We may therefore supply at the beginning of line
35 of the Assyrian version <i lang="obab">[ittaziz] Enkidu</i>,
corresponding to line 197 of the Pennsylvania tablet. Line 36 of IV, 2,
certainly appears to correspond to line 200 (<i lang=
"obab">dan-nu-ti</i> = <i lang=
"obab">da-na-ni-i&scaron;-&scaron;&uacute;</i>).</p>
<p><a href="#p.208">Line 208</a>. The first sign looks more like
<i lang="obab">&scaron;ar</i>, though <i lang="obab">ur</i> is
possible.</p>
<p><a href="#p.211">Line 211</a> is clearly a description of Enkidu, as
is shown by a comparison with the Assyrian version I, 2, 37: <i lang=
"obab">[pi]-ti-ik pi-ir-ti-&scaron;&uacute; u&#7723;-tan-na-ba kima
<sup>d</sup>Nidaba</i>, &ldquo;The form of his hair sprouted like
wheat.&rdquo; We must therefore supply Enkidu in the preceding line.
Tablet IV, 4, 6, of the Assyrian version also contains a reference to
the flowing hair of Enkidu. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="p85" href=
"#p85" name="p85">85</a>]</span></p>
<p><a href="#p.212">Line 212</a>. For the completion of the line cf.
Harper, <i>Assyrian and Babylonian Letters</i>, No. 214.</p>
<p><a href="#p.214">Line 214</a>. For <i lang="obab">rib&icirc;tu
m&acirc;ti</i> see the note above to line 28 of column 1.</p>
<p><a href="#p.215">Lines 215</a>&ndash;217 correspond almost entirely
to the Assyrian version IV, 2, 46&ndash;48. The variations <i lang=
"obab">ki-ib-su</i> in place of <i lang="obab">&scaron;&ecirc;pu</i>,
and <i lang="obab">kima l&icirc;m</i>, &ldquo;like oxen,&rdquo; instead
of <i lang="obab">ina b&acirc;b &ecirc;muti</i> (repeated from line
46), <i lang="obab">ana &scaron;ur&ucirc;bi</i> for <i lang=
"obab">&ecirc;ribam</i>, are slight though interesting. The Assyrian
version shows that the &ldquo;gate&rdquo; in line 215 is &ldquo;the
gate of the family house&rdquo; in which the goddess Ish&#7723;ara
lies.</p>
<p><a href="#p.218">Lines 218</a>&ndash;228. The detailed description
of the fight between the two heroes is only partially preserved in the
Assyrian version.</p>
<p><a href="#p.218">Line 218</a>. <i>li-i-im</i> is evidently to be
taken as plural here as in <a href="#p.224">line 224</a>, just as
<i lang="obab">su-&#7731;i-im</i> (lines 27 and 175), <i lang=
"obab">ri-bi-tim</i> (lines 4, 28, etc.), <i lang=
"obab">tarba&#7779;im</i> (line 74), <i>a&#7779;&#7779;amim</i> (line
98) are plural forms. Our text furnishes, as does also the Yale tablet,
an interesting illustration of the vacillation in the Hammurabi period
in the twofold use of <i lang="obab">im</i>: (a) as an indication of
the plural (as in Hebrew), and (b) as a mere emphatic ending (lines 63,
73, and 232), which becomes predominant in the post-Hammurabi age.</p>
<p><a href="#p.227">Line 227</a>. Gilgamesh is often represented on
seal cylinders as kneeling, e.g., Ward Seal Cylinders Nos. 159, 160,
165. Cf. also Assyrian version V, 3, 6, where Gilgamesh is described as
kneeling, though here in prayer. See further the commentary to the Yale
tablet, line 215.</p>
<p><a href="#p.229">Line 229</a>. We must of course read <i lang=
"obab">uz-za-&scaron;&uacute;</i>, &ldquo;his anger,&rdquo; and not
<i lang="obab">u&#7779;-&#7779;a-&scaron;&uacute;</i>, &ldquo;his
javelin,&rdquo; as Langdon does, which gives no sense.</p>
<p><a href="#p.231">Line 231</a>. Langdon&rsquo;s note is erroneous. He
again misses the point. The stem of the verb here as in <a href=
"#p.230">line 230</a> (<i lang="obab">i-ni-i&#7723;</i>) is the common
<i lang="obab">n&acirc;&#7723;u</i>, used so constantly in connection
with <i lang="obab">pa&scaron;&acirc;&#7723;u</i>, to designate the
cessation of anger.</p>
<p><a href="#p.234">Line 234</a>. <i lang="obab">i&scaron;t&ecirc;n</i>
applied to Gish designates him of course as &ldquo;unique,&rdquo; not
as &ldquo;an ordinary man,&rdquo; as Langdon supposes.</p>
<p><a href="#p.236">Line 236</a>. On this title &ldquo;wild cow of the
stall&rdquo; for Ninsun, see Poebel in <i>OLZ</i> 1914, page 6, to whom
we owe the correct view regarding the name of Gilgamesh&rsquo;s
mother.</p>
<p><a href="#p.238">Line 238</a>. <i>mu-ti</i> here cannot mean
&ldquo;husband,&rdquo; but &ldquo;man&rdquo; in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="p86" href="#p86" name="p86">86</a>]</span>general.
See above note to line 107. Langdon&rsquo;s strange misreading <i lang=
"obab">ri-e&scaron;-su</i> for <i lang="obab">ri-e&scaron;-ka</i>
(&ldquo;thy head&rdquo;) leads him again to miss the point, namely that
Enkidu comforts his rival by telling him that he is destined for a
career above that of the ordinary man. He is to be more than a mere
prize fighter; he is to be a king, and no doubt in the ancient sense,
as the representative of the deity. This is indicated by the statement
that the kingship is decreed for him by Enlil. Similarly,
&#7722;u(m)baba or &#7722;uwawa is designated by Enlil to inspire
terror among men (Assyrian version, Tablet IV, 5, 2 and 5), <i lang=
"obab">i-&scaron;im-&scaron;&uacute; <sup>d</sup>Enlil</i> = Yale
tablet, l. 137, where this is to be supplied. This position accorded to
Enlil is an important index for the origin of the Epic, which is thus
shown to date from a period when the patron deity of Nippur was
acknowledged as the general head of the pantheon. This justifies us in
going back several centuries at least before Hammurabi for the
beginning of the Gilgamesh story. If it had originated in the Hammurabi
period, we should have had Marduk introduced instead of Enlil.</p>
<p><a href="#p.242">Line 242</a>. As has been pointed out in the
corrections to the text (Appendix), <i lang=
"obab">&scaron;&uacute;-tu-ur</i> can only be III, 1, from <i lang=
"obab">at&acirc;ru</i>, &ldquo;to be in excess of.&rdquo; It is a pity
that the balance of the line is broken off, since this is the first
instance of a colophon beginning with the term in question. In some way
<i lang="obab">&scaron;ut&ucirc;r</i> must indicate that the copy of
the text has been &ldquo;enlarged.&rdquo; It is tempting to fill out
the line <i lang="obab">&scaron;&uacute;-tu-ur e-li [duppi labiri]</i>,
and to render &ldquo;enlarged from an original,&rdquo; as an indication
of an independent recension of the Epic in the <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e6255" title="Source: Hummurabi">Hammurabi</span> period. All
this, however, is purely conjectural, and we must patiently hope for
more tablets of the Old Babylonian version to turn up. The chances are
that some portions of the same edition as the Yale and Pennsylvania
tablets are in the hands of dealers at present or have been sold to
European museums. The war has seriously interfered with the possibility
of tracing the whereabouts of groups of tablets that ought never to
have been separated. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="p87" href="#p87"

18&ndash;19.</p>
<p><a href="#y.136">Lines 136</a>&ndash;137. These two lines restored
on the basis of Jensen IV, 5, 2 and 5. The variant in the Assyrian
version, <i lang="obab">&scaron;&aacute; ni&scaron;e</i> (written
Uku<sup>me&scaron;</sup> in one case and Lu<sup>me&scaron;</sup> in the
other), for the numeral 7 in our text to designate a terror of the
largest and most widespread character, is interesting. The number 7 is
similarly used as a designation of Gilgamesh, who is called <i lang=
"obab">Esigga imin</i>, &ldquo;seven-fold strong,&rdquo; i.e.,
supremely strong (CT XVIII, 30, 6&ndash;8). Similarly, Enkidu,
<i>ib.</i> line 10, is designated <i>a-r&aacute; imina</i>,
&ldquo;seven-fold.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="#y.149">Line 149</a>. A difficult line because of the
uncertainty of the reading at the beginning of the following line. The
most obvious meaning of <i lang="obab">mi-it-tu</i> is
&ldquo;corpse,&rdquo; though in the Assyrian version <i lang=
"obab">&scaron;alamtu</i> is used (Assyrian version, Tablet V, 2, 42).
On the other hand, it is possible&mdash;as Dr. Lutz suggested to
me&mdash;that <i lang="obab">mittu</i>, despite the manner of writing,
is identical with <i lang="obab">mi&#7789;&#7789;&uacute;</i>, the name
of a divine weapon, well-known from the Assyrian creation myth (Tablet
IV, 130), and other passages. The combination <i lang=
"obab">mi&#7789;-&#7789;u &scaron;&aacute;-&#7731;u-&uacute;-</i>,
&ldquo;lofty weapon,&rdquo; in the Bilingual text IV, R&sup2;, 18 No.
3, 31&ndash;32, would favor the meaning &ldquo;weapon&rdquo; in our
passage, since <i lang="obab">[&scaron;&aacute;]-&#7731;u-tu</i> is a
possible restoration at the beginning of line 150. However, the writing
<i lang="obab">mi-it-ti</i> points too distinctly to a derivative of
the stem <i lang="obab">m&acirc;tu</i>, and until a satisfactory
explanation of lines 150&ndash;152 is forthcoming, we must stick to the
meaning &ldquo;corpse&rdquo; and read the verb <i lang=
"obab">il-&#7731;u-ut</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#y.152">Line 152</a>. The context suggests
&ldquo;lion&rdquo; for the puzzling <i>la-bu</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#y.156">Line 156</a>. Another puzzling line. Dr.
Clay&rsquo;s copy is an accurate reproduction of what is
distinguishable. At the close of the line there appears to be a sign
written over an erasure.</p>
<p><a href="#y.158">Line 158</a>. <i lang="obab">[ga-ti

&ldquo;I will place my hand,&rdquo; i.e., I purpose, I am determined.

<p><a href="#y.160">Line 160</a>. The restoration on the basis of the
parallel <a href="#y.187">line 187</a>. Note the interesting phrase,
&ldquo;writing a name&rdquo; in the sense of acquiring
&ldquo;fame.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="#y.161">Line 161</a>. The <i lang=
"obab">ki&scaron;katt&ecirc;</i>, &ldquo;artisans,&rdquo; are
introduced also in the Assyrian version, Tablet VI, 187, to look at the
enormous size and weight of the horns of the slain divine bull. See for
other passages Muss-Arnolt <i>Assyrian Dictionary</i>, p.
450<sup>b</sup>. At the beginning of this line, we must seek for the
same word as in line 163.</p>
<p><a href="#y.162">Line 162</a>. While the restoration <i lang=
"obab">bel&ecirc;</i>, &ldquo;weapon,&rdquo; is purely conjectural, the
context clearly demands some such word. I choose <i lang=
"obab">bel&ecirc;</i> in preference to <i>kakk&ecirc;</i>, in view of
the Assyrian version, Tablet VI, 1.</p>
<p><a href="#y.163">Line 163</a>. <i lang="obab">Putuku</i> (or
<i lang="obab">putukku</i>) from <i lang="obab">pat&acirc;ku</i> would
be an appropriate word for the fabrication of weapons.</p>
<p><a href="#y.165">Line 165</a>. The <i lang="obab">rab&ucirc;tim</i>
here, as in <a href="#y.167">line 167</a>, I take as the &ldquo;master
mechanics&rdquo; as contrasted with the <i lang="obab">ummianu</i>,
&ldquo;common workmen,&rdquo; or journeymen. A parallel to this forging
of the weapons for the two heroes is to be found in the Sumerian
fragment of the Gilgamesh Epic published by Langdon, <i>Historical and
Religious Texts from the Temple Library of Nippur</i> (Munich, 1914),
No. 55, 1&ndash;15.</p>
<p><a href="#y.168">Lines 168</a>&ndash;170 describe the forging of the
various parts of the lances for the two heroes. The <i lang=
"obab">&#7779;ipru</i> is the spear point Muss-Arnolt, <i>Assyrian
Dictionary</i>, p. 886<sup>b</sup>; the <i>i&scaron;id pa&#7789;ri</i>
is clearly the &ldquo;hilt,&rdquo; and the <i lang=
"obab">me&scaron;elitum</i> I therefore take as the &ldquo;blade&rdquo;
proper. The word occurs here for the first time, so far as I can see.
For 30 minas, see Assyrian version, Tablet VI, 189, as the weight of
the two horns of the divine bull. Each axe weighing 3 <i lang=
"obab">biltu</i>, and the lance with point and hilt 3 <i lang=
"obab">biltu</i> we would have to assume 4 <i lang="obab">biltu</i> for
each <i lang="obab">pa&scaron;u</i>, so as to get a total of 10
<i lang="obab">biltu</i> as the weight of the weapons for each hero.
The lance is depicted on seal cylinders representing Gilgamesh and
Enkidu, for example, Ward, <i>Seal Cylinders</i>, No. 199, and also in
Nos. 184 and 191 in the field, with the broad hilt; and in an enlarged
form in No. 648. Note the clear indication of the hilt. The two figures
are Gilgamesh and Enkidu&mdash;not two Gilgameshes, as Ward assumed.
See above, page 34. A different weapon is the club or mace, as seen in
Ward, Nos. 170 and 173. This appears also to be the weapon which
Gilgamesh holds in his hand on the colossal figure from the palace of
Sargon (Jastrow, <i>Civilization of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="p99"
href="#p99" name="p99">99</a>]</span>Babylonia and Assyria</i>, Pl.
LVII), though it has been given a somewhat grotesque character by a
perhaps intentional approach to the scimitar, associated with Marduk
(see Ward, <i>Seal Cylinders</i>, Chap. XXVII). The exact determination
of the various weapons depicted on seal-cylinders merits a special
study.</p>
<p><a href="#y.181">Line 181</a>. Begins a speech of &#7722;uwawa,
extending to <a href="#y.187">line 187</a>, reported to Gish by the
elders (line 188&ndash;189), who add a further warning to the youthful
and impetuous hero.</p>
<p><a href="#y.183">Line 183</a>. <i lang=
"obab">lu-uk-&scaron;&uacute;-su</i> (also <a href="#y.186">l.
186</a>), from <i lang="obab">ak&acirc;&scaron;u</i>, &ldquo;drive
on&rdquo; or &ldquo;lure on,&rdquo; occurs on the Pennsylvania tablet,
line 135, <i lang="obab">uk-ki-&scaron;i</i>, &ldquo;lure on&rdquo; or
&ldquo;entrap,&rdquo; which Langdon erroneously renders &ldquo;take
away&rdquo; and thereby misses the point completely. See the comment to
the line of the Pennsylvania tablet in question.</p>
<p><a href="#y.192">Line 192</a>. On the phrase <i lang=
"obab">&scaron;an&ucirc; bunu</i>, &ldquo;change of countenance,&rdquo;
in the sense of &ldquo;enraged,&rdquo; see the note to the Pennsylvania
tablet, l.31.</p>
<p><a href="#y.194">Line 194</a>. <i lang="obab">nu-ma-at</i> occurs in
a tablet published by Meissner, <i lang="de">Altbabyl. Privatrecht</i>,
No. 100, with <i lang="obab">b&icirc;t abi</i>, which shows that the
total confine of a property is meant; here, therefore, the
&ldquo;interior&rdquo; of the forest or heart. It is hardly a
&ldquo;by-form&rdquo; of <i lang="obab">nuptum</i> as Muss-Arnolt,
<i>Assyrian Dictionary</i>, p. 690<sup>b</sup>, and others have
supposed, though <i lang="obab">nu-um-tum</i> in one passage quoted by
Muss-Arnolt, <i>ib.</i> p. 705<sup>a</sup>, may have arisen from an
aspirate pronunciation of the <i>p</i> in <i lang=
"obab">nubtum</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#y.215">Line 215</a>. The kneeling attitude of prayer is an
interesting touch. It symbolizes submission, as is shown by the
description of Gilgamesh&rsquo;s defeat in the encounter with Enkidu
(Pennsylvania tablet, l. 227), where Gilgamesh is represented as forced
to &ldquo;kneel&rdquo; to the ground. Again in the Assyrian version,
Tablet V, 4, 6, Gilgamesh kneels down (though the reading <i lang=
"obab">ka-mis</i> is not certain) and has a vision.</p>
<p><a href="#y.229">Line 229</a>. It is much to be regretted that this
line is so badly preserved, for it would have enabled us definitely to
restore the opening line of the Assyrian version of the Gilgamesh Epic.
The fragment published by Jeremias in his appendix to his
<i>Izdubar-Nimrod</i>, Plate IV, gives us the end of the colophon line
to the Epic, reading &hellip;&hellip;&hellip; <i lang="obab">di
ma-a-ti</i> (cf. <i>ib.</i>, Pl. I, 1. &hellip; <i lang=
"obab">a-ti</i>). Our text evidently reproduces the same phrase and
enables us to supply <i lang="obab">ka</i>, as well as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="p100" href="#p100" name="p100">100</a>]</span>the
name of the hero Gi&scaron;h of which there are distinct traces. The
missing word, therefore, describes the hero as the ruler, or controller
of the land. But what are the two signs before <i lang="obab">ka</i>? A
participial form from <i lang="obab">pak&acirc;du</i>, which one
naturally thinks of, is impossible because of the <i lang=
"obab">ka</i>, and for the same reason one cannot supply the word for
shepherd (<i lang="obab">nakidu</i>). One might think of <i lang=
"obab">ka-ak-ka-du</i>, except that <i lang="obab">kakkadu</i> is not
used for &ldquo;head&rdquo; in the sense of &ldquo;chief&rdquo; of the
land. I venture to restore <i lang="obab">[i-ik-]ka-di</i>,
&ldquo;strong one.&rdquo; Our text at all events disposes of
Haupt&rsquo;s conjecture <i lang="obab">i&scaron;-di ma-a-ti</i>
(<i>JAOS</i> 22, p. 11), &ldquo;Bottom of the earth,&rdquo; as also of
Ungnad&rsquo;s proposed <i lang="obab">[a-di pa]-a-ti</i>, &ldquo;to
the ends&rdquo; (Ungnad-Gressmann, <i lang="de">Gilgamesch-Epos</i>, p.
6, note), or a reading <i lang="obab">di-ma-a-ti</i>,
&ldquo;pillars.&rdquo; The first line of the Assyrian version would now
read</p>
<div lang="obab" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>&scaron;&aacute; nak-ba i-mu-ru
[<sup>d</sup>Gis-gi(n)-ma&scaron; i-ik-ka]-di ma-a-ti</i>,</p>
</div>
<p class="first">i.e., &ldquo;The one who saw everything, Gilgamesh the
strong one (?) of the land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We may at all events be quite certain that the name of the hero
occurred in the first line and that he was described by some epithet
indicating his superior position.</p>
<p><a href="#y.229">Lines 229</a>&ndash;235 are again an address of
Gilgamesh to the sun-god, after having received a favorable
&ldquo;oracle&rdquo; from the god (line 222). The hero promises to
honor and to celebrate the god, by erecting thrones for him.</p>
<p><a href="#y.237">Lines 237</a>&ndash;244 describe the arming of the
hero by the &ldquo;master&rdquo; craftsman. In addition to the <i lang=
"obab">pa&scaron;u</i> and <i lang="obab">pa&#7789;ru</i>, the bow (?)
and quiver are given to him.</p>
<p><a href="#y.249">Line 249</a> is paralleled in the new fragment of
the Assyrian version published by King in <i>PSBA</i> 1914, page 66
(col. 1, 2), except that this fragment adds <i lang="obab">gi-mir</i>
to <i lang="obab">e-mu-&#7731;i-ka</i>.</p>
<p><a href="#y.251">Lines 251</a>&ndash;252 correspond to column 1,
6&ndash;8, of King&rsquo;s fragment, with interesting variations
&ldquo;battle&rdquo; and &ldquo;fight&rdquo; instead of
&ldquo;way&rdquo; and &ldquo;road,&rdquo; which show that in the
interval between the old Babylonian and the Assyrian version, the real
reason why Enkidu should lead the way, namely, because he knows the
country in which &#7722;uwawa dwells (lines 252&ndash;253), was
supplemented by describing Enkidu also as being more experienced in
battle than Gilgamesh.</p>
<p><a href="#y.254">Line 254</a>. I am unable to furnish a satisfactory
rendering for this line, owing to the uncertainty of the word at the
end. Can it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="p101" href="#p101" name=
"p101">101</a>]</span>be &ldquo;his household,&rdquo; from the stem
which in Hebrew gives us <span lang=

&ldquo;family?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="#y.255">Line 255</a>. Is paralleled by col. 1, 4, of
King&rsquo;s new fragment. The episode of Gi&scaron;h and Enkidu
proceeding to Ninsun, the mother of Gish, to obtain her counsel, which
follows in King&rsquo;s fragment, appears to have been omitted in the
old Babylonian version. Such an elaboration of the tale is exactly what
we should expect as it passed down the ages.</p>
<p><a href="#y.257">Line 257</a>. Our text shows that <i lang=
"obab">irnittu</i> (lines 257, 264, 265) means primarily
&ldquo;endeavor,&rdquo; and then success in one&rsquo;s endeavor, or
&ldquo;triumph.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="#y.266">Lines 266</a>&ndash;270. Do not appear to refer to
rites performed after a victory, as might at a first glance appear, but
merely voice the hope that Gi&scaron;h will completely take possession
of &#7722;uwawa&rsquo;s territory, so as to wash up after the fight in
&#7722;uwawa&rsquo;s own stream; and the hope is also expressed that he
may find pure water in &#7722;uwawa&rsquo;s land in abundance, to offer
a libation to &Scaron;hama&scaron;h.</p>

<p>[Note on Sabitum (above, <a href="#p11">p. 11</a>)</p>
<p>In a communication before the Oriental Club of Philadelphia (Feb.
10, 1920), Prof. Haupt made the suggestion that <i lang=
"obab">sa-bi-tum</i> (or <i lang="obab">tu</i>), hitherto regarded as a
proper name, is an epithet describing the woman who dwells at the
seashore which Gilgamesh in the course of his wanderings reaches, as an
&ldquo;innkeeper&rdquo;. It is noticeable that the term always appears
without the determinative placed before proper names; and since in the
old Babylonian version (so far as preserved) and in the Assyrian
version, the determinative is invariably used, its consistent absence
in the case of <i lang="obab">sabitum</i> (Assyrian Version, Tablet X,
1, 1, 10, 15, 20; 2, 15&ndash;16 [<i lang="obab">sa-bit</i>]; Meissner
fragment col. 2, 11&ndash;12) speaks in favor of Professor
Haupt&rsquo;s suggestion. The meaning &ldquo;innkeeper&rdquo;, while
not as yet found in Babylonian-Assyrian literature is most plausible,
since we have <i lang="obab">sab&#363;</i> as a general name for
&rsquo;drink&rsquo;, though originally designating perhaps more
specifically sesame wine (Muss-Arnolt, Assyrian Dictionary, p.
745<sup>b</sup>) or distilled brandy, according to Prof. Haupt.
Similarly, in the Aramaic dialects, <i>s<sup>e</sup>b<sup>h</sup>a</i>
is used for &ldquo;to drink&rdquo; and in the Pael to &ldquo;furnish
drink&rdquo;. Muss-Arnolt in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="p102" href=
"#p102" name="p102">102</a>]</span>his Assyrian Dictionary,
746<sup>b</sup>, has also recognized that <i lang="obab">sabitum</i>
was originally an epithet and compares the Aramaic
<i>s<sup>e</sup>b<sup>h</sup>oy&acirc;th&acirc;</i>(p1)
&ldquo;barmaids&rdquo;. In view of the bad reputation of inns in
ancient Babylonia as brothels, it would be natural for an epithet like
<i>sabitum</i> to become the equivalent to &ldquo;public&rdquo; women,
just as the inn was a &ldquo;public&rdquo; house. Sabitum would,
therefore, have the same force as <i lang=
"obab">&scaron;am&#7723;atu</i> (the &ldquo;harlot&rdquo;), used in the
Gilgamesh Epic by the side of <i lang="obab">&#7723;arimtu</i>
&ldquo;woman&rdquo; (see the note to line 46 of Pennsylvania Tablet).
The Sumerian term for the female innkeeper is Sal Ge&scaron;tinna
&ldquo;the woman of the wine,&rdquo; known to us from the Hammurabi
Code &sect;&sect;108&ndash;111. The bad reputation of inns is confirmed
by these statutes, for the house of the Sal Ge&scaron;tinna is a
gathering place for outlaws. The punishment of a female devotee who
enters the &ldquo;house of a wine woman&rdquo; (b&icirc;t Sal
Ge&scaron;tinna &sect;110) is death. It was not
&ldquo;prohibition&rdquo; that prompted so severe a punishment, but the
recognition of the purpose for which a devotee would enter such a house
of ill repute. The speech of the <i lang="obab">sabitum</i> or
innkeeper to Gilgamesh (above, <a href="#p12">p. 12</a>) was,
therefore, an invitation to stay with her, instead of seeking for life
elsewhere. Viewed as coming from a &ldquo;public woman&rdquo; the
address becomes significant. The invitation would be parallel to the
temptation offered by the <i lang="obab">&#7723;arimtu</i> in the first
tablet of the Enkidu, and to which Enkidu succumbs. The incident in the
tablet would, therefore, form a parallel in the adventures of Gilgamesh
to the one that originally belonged to the Enkidu cycle. Finally, it is
quite possible that <i lang="obab">sabitum</i> is actually the Akkadian
equivalent of the Sumerian Sal Ge&scaron;tinna, though naturally until
this equation is confirmed by a syllabary or by other direct evidence,
it remains a conjecture. See now also Albright&rsquo;s remarks on
Sabitum in the A. J. S. L. 36, pp. 269 <i>seq.</i>] <span class=

<p>12. Langdon&rsquo;s note 8 is wrong. <i lang=

<i lang="obab">bi-i&scaron;-ti</i>, which leads Langdon to render this
perfectly simple line &ldquo;of the conditions and the fate of the
land&rdquo;(!).</p>
<p>21. Read <i lang="obab">it-tam-ru</i> instead of <i lang=

<i lang="obab">&uacute;</i> and <i lang="obab">gi-ir-ri</i>, as Langdon
does, who translates &ldquo;and the lion.&rdquo; The sign used can
<i>never</i> stand for the copula! Nor is <i lang="obab">girru</i>,
&ldquo;lion!&rdquo;</p>
<p>30. Read <i lang="obab">S&iacute;b<sup>me&scaron;</sup></i>,
&ldquo;shepherds,&rdquo; instead of <i lang=
"obab">&scaron;ab-[&scaron;i]-e&scaron;</i>!</p>
<p>31. <i lang="obab">&scaron;ib-ba-ri</i> is not &ldquo;mountain
goat,&rdquo; nor can <i lang="obab">ut-tap-pi-i&scaron;</i> mean
&ldquo;capture.&rdquo; The first word means &ldquo;dagger,&rdquo; and
the second &ldquo;he drew out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>33. Read <i lang="obab">it-ti-[lu] na-ki-[di-e]</i>, instead of
<i lang="obab">itti immer nakie</i> which yields no sense.
Langdon&rsquo;s rendering, even on the basis of his reading of the
line, is a grammatical monstrosity.</p>
<p>35. Read <i lang="obab">gi&scaron;</i> instead of <i lang=

<p>9. The fourth sign is <i>su</i>, not <i>&scaron;&uacute;</i>.</p>
<p>10. Separate <i lang="obab">e-e&scaron;</i> (&ldquo;why&rdquo;) from
the following. Read <i>ta-&#7723;i-[il]</i>, followed, perhaps, by

<i lang="obab">na-a&#7723; &hellip; ma</i>, which, naturally, Langdon
cannot translate.</p>
<p>16. Read <i lang="obab">e-lu-tim</i> instead of <i lang=
"obab">pa-a-ta-tim</i>. The first sign of the line, <i lang=
"obab">tu</i>, is not certain, because apparently written over an
erasure. The second sign may be <i lang="obab">a</i>. Some one has
scratched the tablet at this point.</p>
<p>18. Read <i lang="obab">uk-la-at &acirc;li</i> (?) instead of

sign <i lang="obab">pi</i> is unmistakable. This disposes of note 1 on
p. 218.</p>
<p>9. Read Mi = <i lang="obab">&#7779;almu</i>, &ldquo;image.&rdquo;
This disposes of Langdon&rsquo;s note 2 on page 218. Of six notes on
this page, four are wrong.</p>
<p>11. The first sign appears to be <i lang="obab">si</i> and the
second <i lang="obab">ma</i>. At the end we are perhaps to supply
<i lang="obab">[&scaron;&aacute;-ki-i pu]-uk-ku-ul</i>, on the basis of
the Assyrian version, Tablet IV, 2, 45, <i lang=

<p>5. Supply <i lang="obab">[il-li-ik]</i>.</p>
<p>21. Langdon&rsquo;s text has a superfluous <i lang=

<i>ri-e&scaron;-su</i>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="p106" href=

<p>In general, it should be noted that the indications of the number of
lines missing at the bottom of columns 1&ndash;3 and at the top of
columns 4&ndash;6 as given by Langdon are misleading. Nor should he
have drawn any lines at the bottom of columns 1&ndash;3 as though the
tablet were complete. Besides in very many cases the space indications
of what is missing within a line are inaccurate. Dr. Langdon also
omitted to copy the statement on the edge: <i lang="obab">4
&scaron;&uacute;-&scaron;i</i>, i.e., &ldquo;240 lines;&rdquo; and in
the colophon he mistranslates <i lang=
"obab">&scaron;&uacute;-tu-ur</i>, &ldquo;written,&rdquo; as though
from <i lang="obab">&scaron;a&#7789;&acirc;ru</i>, &ldquo;write,&rdquo;
whereas the form is the permansive III, 1, of <i lang=
"obab">at&acirc;ru</i>, &ldquo;to be in excess of.&rdquo; The sign
<i lang="obab">tu</i> never has the value <i lang="obab">&#7789;u</i>!
In all, Langdon has misread the text or mistransliterated it in over
forty places, and of the 204 preserved lines he has mistranslated about
one-half.</p>
